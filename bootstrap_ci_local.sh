# We use a volume on /var/lib/docker as overlayfs trashes performance (in fact it just breaks).
# We mount in aws credentials to leverage the s3 cache.
# The host repository is mounted in read-only, and a clone is taken to ensure a clean start.
# If anything goes wrong during the run, the container will drop into a shell.

# TODO: The docker flows need to pull images. Kinda sucks as they're right on the host (and maybe more up-to-date).
# Preload them in?
# The docker volume makes the image partly stateful.
