# aztec3::circuits::apps

All code in this dir is for:
- Demonstrating how our users' (developers) apps will need to be written, in terms of:
    - Public inputs
    - Syntax for State Variables & UTXOs
    - Function calls
- To help illustrate ideas to the Noir team
- To allow test app circuits to be mocked-up as quickly and easily as possible, for use in the Kernel & Rollup circuits.
