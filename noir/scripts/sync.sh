# Special message we use to indicate the commit we do after the fixup.
# This commit has changes we do *not* want to migrate back to Noir,
# they exist only to make the Noir codebase work with the projects
# in aztec-packages, rather than their released versions.
FIXUP_COMMIT_MSG="Noir local fixup commit."
# Special message we use to indicate the commit we do after applying
# any patch file committed in aztec-packages, which contains changes
# Aztec developers made to Noir. These are changes we do want to see
# migrated back to Noir eventually, after which the patch file can
# be removed.
PATCH_COMMIT_MSG="Noir local patch commit."
# There can be a patch file committed in `aztec-packages` with commits
# to be applied on top of any Noir checkout.
# The `noir/bootstrap.sh make-patch` commands takes all commits since
# the local fixup commit and compiles them into this single patch file,
# (so it will include previously applied patch commits as well as new ones),
# replacing any previous value.
# The patch commits can be pushed to Noir if they represent bugfixes;
# to do so we have to rebase on the origin and remove the fixup commit.
