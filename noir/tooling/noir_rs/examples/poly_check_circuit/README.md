# `noir_rs`: Polynomial Value Check Circuit Example

## Introduction

Welcome to the `noir_rs` library, a Rust-based library designed for creating and working with zero-knowledge proofs. This example demonstrates the use of `noir_rs` in conjunction with `nargo`, showcasing a single project structure.

The Polynomial Value Check Circuit example illustrates how to construct and verify a circuit that checks the value of a polynomial at a given point.

## Running the Example

To run the Polynomial Value Check Circuit example, follow these steps:

1. **Compile the Circuit**

   Use `nargo` to compile the circuit:

   ```bash
   nargo compile
   ```

2. **Run the Circuit**

   Once compiled, you can run the circuit using Cargo: (compiles barretenberg backend will take a while)

   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

This will execute the example, demonstrating the functionality of the `noir_rs` library in a practical scenario.
