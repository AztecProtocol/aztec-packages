# Contract-Only Box

This box is a one-stop-shop for Aztec with the token_contract example contract. You can use it as a boilerplate to start developing your own Aztec app in seconds!

## How to start

The script copied one of the example contracts and put it into a one-size-fits-all "box". With it, you can run commands such as:

- `yarn test` -> Runs the built-in tests
- `yarn compile` -> Compiles your contract so it can be deployed
- `yarn codegen` -> Generates a handy TS interface file with all your contract's methods so they're easy to interact with
- `yarn clean` -> Removes artifacts and other things you may not want to have lying around
- `yarn formatting` -> Formats your code with prettier
-  

## Testing

Contract-only boxes give you basic test functionality through `jest`, and check for existence and correct working of the sandbox.

If you want some ideas to test the contract you just bootstrapped, check out [our own e2e test suite!](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/end-to-end/src/e2e_token_contract.test.ts)
