# Aztec Box

This box is a one-stop-shop for Aztec that will deploy a minimal React page. You can use it as a boilerplate to start developing your own Aztec app in seconds!

## Getting Started

The easiest way to start is with a Github Codespaces, which has a generous free tier. Just click on this button:

[![One-Click React Starter](.devcontainer/assets/react_cta_badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages?devcontainer_path=.devcontainer%2Freact%2Fdevcontainer.json)

## Using the `npx` command

The above method just uses the `npx` command, AKA "unboxing the box". This is a CLI command to quickly start developing on your own machine.

### Prerequisites

- Node >v18
- Docker

### Usage

Just open a terminal and write:

```bash
npx aztec-app
```
