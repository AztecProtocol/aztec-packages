# Contract-Only Box

This box is a one-stop-shop for Aztec with the %%contract_name%% example contract. You can use it as a boilerplate to start developing your own Aztec app in seconds!

## Testing

Contract-only boxes give you basic test functionality through `jest`, and check for existence and correct working of the sandbox.

If you want some ideas to test the contract you just bootstrapped, check out [our own e2e test suite!](%%e2e_test_url%%)
