# Conditionally runs a script on a remote spot instance if any dependent code has changed between
# the last successful run and the present commit.
#
# It's expected to be run from the project directory, and that there be a directory called `scripts`
# containing the given named script to execute on the remote machine.
#
# This script is only useful if there is nothing to do in the event there is no rebuild. This is fine
# for running a suite of tests for example, but is not useful for performing a build, as even if a
# build has nothing to do, the previous images are retagged with the new commit hash for upstream jobs.
#
# Arguments are:
# 1. REPOSITORY: The project repository name in ECR. Used to determine if there are changes since last success.
# 2. SUCCESS_TAG: To track if this job needs to be run, the repository image is tagged with a prefix after a
#    successful run. The script will only run if there were relevant code changes since the last successful commit.
# 3... ARGS: Arguments to pass to spot_run_script.
