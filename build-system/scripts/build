# Builds a docker image and pushes it to it's repository. Leverages caches where possible.
# Cached images include previous successfully built images (including multi-stages) built on this branch.
# The images output are cache images, meaning they will eventually get purged.
# The deploy phase will tag the images such that they become permanent.
#
# usage: ./build <repository>
# example: ./build aztec-connect-cpp-x86_64-linux-clang
# output image:
#   278380418400.dkr.ecr.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/aztec-connect-cpp-x86_64-linux-clang:cache-deadbeefcafebabe1337c0d3-x86_64
#
# In more detail:
# - Init all submodules required to build this project.
# - Log into cache ECR, and ensures repository exists.
# - Validate any terraform that may exist.
# - For images built previously in pipeline, pull the image we've built.
# - Perform the build of the image itself.
# - Push the image tagged with the content hash to the cache.
