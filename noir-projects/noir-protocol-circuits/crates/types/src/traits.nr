// Trait: is_empty
//
// The general is_empty trait checks if a data type is is empty,
// and it defines empty for the basic data types as 0.
//
// If a Field is equal to zero, then it is regarded as zero.
// We will go with this definition for now, however it can be problematic
// if a value can actually be zero. In a future refactor, we can
// use the optional type for safety. Doing it now would lead to a worse devex
// and would make it harder to sync up with the cpp code.
// Preferred over Default trait to convey intent, as default doesn't necessarily mean empty.

// docs:start:serialize
/// Trait for serializing Noir types into arrays of Fields.
///
/// An implementation of the Serialize trait has to follow Noir's intrinsic serialization (each member of a struct
/// converted directly into one or more Fields without any packing or compression). This trait (and Deserialize) are
/// typically used to communicate between Noir and TypeScript (via oracles and function arguments).
///
/// # On Following Noir's Intrinsic Serialization
/// When calling a Noir function from TypeScript (TS), first the function arguments are serialized into an array
/// of fields. This array is then included in the initial witness. Noir's intrinsic serialization is then used
/// to deserialize the arguments from the witness. When the same Noir function is called from Noir this Serialize trait
/// is used instead of the serialization in TS. For this reason we need to have a match between TS serialization,
/// Noir's intrinsic serialization and the implementation of this trait. If there is a mismatch, the function calls
/// fail with an arguments hash mismatch error message.
///
/// # Type Parameters
/// * `N` - The length of the output Field array, known at compile time
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// impl<let N: u32> Serialize<N> for str<N> {
///     fn serialize(self) -> [Field; N] {
///         let bytes = self.as_bytes();
///         let mut fields = [0; N];
///         for i in 0..bytes.len() {
///             fields[i] = bytes[i] as Field;  // Each byte gets its own Field
///         }
///         fields
///     }
