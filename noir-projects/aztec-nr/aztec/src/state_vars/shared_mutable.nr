//    another nor needing to coordinate)
// This is famously a hard problem to solve. SharedMutable makes it work by introducing a delay to public mutation:
// the value is not changed immediately but rather a value change is scheduled to happen in the future after some delay
// measured in blocks. Reads in private are only valid as long as they are included in a block not too far into the
// future, so that they can guarantee the value will not have possibly changed by then (because of the delay).
// The delay for changing a value is initially equal to INITIAL_DELAY, but can be changed by calling
// `schedule_delay_change`.
