        // to the kernel, and it gets included as part of its public inputs. Then we send the tx to the sequencer,
        // which includes the kernel proof and the log preimages. The sequencer computes the hashes of the logs
        // and checks that they are the ones in the public inputs of the kernel, and drops the tx otherwise (proposing
        // the block on L1 would later fail if it didn't because of txs effects hash mismatch).
        //   So if we don't constrain the log hash, then a malicious sender can compute the correct log, submit a bad
        // log hash to the kernel, and then submit the bad log preimage to the sequencer. All checks will pass, but
        // the submitted log will not be the one that was computed by the app.
        //   In the unconstrained case, we don't care about the log at all because we don't do anything with it,
        // and because it's unconstrained: it could be anything. So if a sender chooses to broadcast the tx with a log
        // that is different from the one that was used in the circuit, then they'll be able to, but they were already
        // able to change the log before anyway, so the end result is the same. It's important here that we do not
        // return the log from this function to the app, otherwise it could try to do stuff with it and then that might
        // be wrong.
        //   Regarding the note hash counter, this is used for squashing. The kernel assumes that a given note can have
        // more than one log and removes all of the matching ones, so all a malicious sender could do is either: cause
        // for the log to be deleted when it shouldn't have (which is fine - they can already make the content be
        // whatever), or cause for the log to not be deleted when it should have (which is also fine - it'll be a log
