/// The note's `content` is what `getNotes` will later return. PXE indexes notes by `storage_slot`, so this value is
/// typically used to filter notes that correspond to different state variables. `note_hash` and `nullifier` are the
/// inner hashes, i.e. the raw hashes returned by `NoteInterface::compute_note_hash` and
/// `NullifiableNote::compute_nullifier`. PXE will verify that the siloed unique note hash was inserted into the tree at
/// `tx_hash`, and will store the nullifier to later check for nullification.
///
/// `recipient` is the account to which the note was sent to. Other accounts will not be able to access this note (e.g.
/// other accounts will not be able to see one another's token balance notes, even in the same PXE) unless authorized.

/// Returns true if the note was sucessfully delivered and added to PXE's database.
