# Mocked protocol circuits

These simplified circuits act as a way of testing the IVC integration between noir and barretenberg. They follow the same IVC scheme as the real circuits, but are much simpler and easier to reason about.

# Public Kernel

The folder public-kernel is currently used to test the noir integration of the avm recursive verifier.
