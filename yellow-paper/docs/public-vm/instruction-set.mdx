# Instruction Set

This page lists all of the instructions supported by the Aztec Virtual Machine (AVM).

The following notes are relevant to the table and sections below:
- `M[offset]` notation is shorthand for `context.machineState.memory[offset]`
- Any instruction whose description does not mention a program counter change simply increments it: `context.machineState.pc++`
- All instructions update `context.machineState.*GasLeft` as detailed in ["Gas limits and tracking"](./avm#gas-limits-and-tracking)
- Any instruction can lead to an exceptional halt as specified in ["Exceptional halting"](./avm#exceptional-halting)
