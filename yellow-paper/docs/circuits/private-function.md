# Private Function Circuit

## Requirements

Private function circuits represent smart contract functions that modify the Aztec private state trees. They serve as untrusted, third-party code that is executed as part of evaluating an Aztec transaction.

The logic of each private function circuit is tailored to the needs of a particular application or scenario, yet its public inputs must adhere to a specific format. This circuit should be designed to handle private data processing while generating public inputs that safeguard the application and account's intentions without compromising sensitive information.

## Private Inputs

The private inputs of a private function circuit are customizable.

## Public Inputs

The public inputs of a private function circuit will be incorporated into the private inputs of a private kernel circuit. Private kernel circuits leverage these public inputs, coupled with proof data and verification key from a private function circuit, to prove the correct execution of a private function.

The following format defines the ABI that is used by the private kernel circuit when processing private function public inputs:
