# Multivariate Fee Mechanism

We charge transactions based on their "compute" and "DA" costs. Each transaction is published with:

- `da_gas_used`
- `compute_gas_used`

Presently, `compute_gas_used` is set to a fixed value of `1`. This will be updated after the public VM is integrated.

`*_gas_used` is used in this document to refer to either `da_gas_used` or `compute_gas_used`.

# DA Layer

The DA solution in use is ethereum call data. A moderate effort has been made to design a system that can transition to a different solution in the future, e.g. blobs.

# DA Costs per Transaction

A transaction consumes a variable amount of DA gas, calculated as:

```
da_gas_used = FIXED_DA_GAS +
                note_hash_gas +
                nullifier_gas +
                l2_to_l1_message_gas +
                public_data_writes_gas +
                log_gas
```

where

```
FIXED_DA_GAS = FIXED_BYTES * DA_GAS_PER_BYTE

# 8 bytes for `da_gas_used`, 8 bytes for `compute_gas_used`, 1 byte for `revert_code`
FIXED_BYTES = 17
DA_GAS_PER_BYTE = 16
```

and

```
note_hash_gas = da_gas_per_field * (number of notes)
nullifier_gas = da_gas_per_field * (number of nullifiers)
l2_to_l1_message_gas = da_gas_per_field * (number of l2_to_l1_messages)
public_data_writes_gas = 2 * da_gas_per_field * (number of public_data_writes)

BYTES_PER_FIELD = 32
da_gas_per_field = BYTES_PER_FIELD * DA_GAS_PER_BYTE
```

finally

```
log_gas = DA_GAS_PER_BYTE * (unencrypted_log_preimages_length + encrypted_log_preimages_length)
```

## Deviation from ethereum calldata pricing

Our `da_gas_used` will be correlated with the actual ethereum gas consumed by the published call, but not equal.

This is because calculating the exact cost requires us to know how many non-zero bytes are in the calldata, which includes the `da_gas_used` itself. Since the `da_gas_used` must be produced in our kernel circuits, such a recursive calculation would unnecessarily complicate the circuit design.

Instead, using a fixed cost plus scaling on actual resources consumed dramatically simplifies calculations, is a reasonable approximation, and affords abstraction if/when we transition to a different DA solution.

## Inclusion in published transactions

The `*_gas_used` values are included in the [published transaction data](../data-publication-and-availability/published-data.md).

# Proving

## Tracking in kernels

In the private kernel tail, we split side effects into `revertible` and `non-revertible` sets.

Since the revertible set may be dropped, we must track `da_gas_used` for each set.

Thus, we have `*_gas_used: u64` in all the "accumulated data" structs throughout the kernel:

- `PrivateAccumulatedRevertibleData`
- `PrivateAccumulatedNonRevertibleData`
- `PublicAccumulatedRevertibleData`
- `PublicAccumulatedNonRevertibleData`
- `CombinedAccumulatedData`

## DA metering for private

We compute the `da_gas_used` for both the `revertible` and `non-revertible` sets in the private kernel tail, according to the formula above.

## No public metering at present

It is unknown how the public kernel and public VM will interact on DA gas. Ideally, the public VM would meter DA gas and publish results/reverts to the kernel.

For the present, the `*_gas_used` fields will be forwarded through the public kernel.

<!-- TODO(@just-mitch) sync with VM team -->

## Recombining for base rollup

Presently we recombine the `PublicAccumulatedRevertibleData` and `PublicAccumulatedNonRevertibleData` into `CombinedAccumulatedData` in TypeScript (issue [#5013](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/5013)).

This recombination includes `da_gas_used` and `compute_gas_used`, computed as

```
combined.da_gas_used = non_revertible.da_gas_used +
                        non_revertible.revert_code == 0 ? revertible.da_gas_used : 0
```

## Content commitment

The `*_gas_used` values are included in the content commitment for the base rollup.

The values are up-casted from `u64` to `Field` for the content commitment.

This is matched when

## Current state diagram

The current state diagram is as follows:

```mermaid

stateDiagram-v2
    ar1 : AccumulatedRevertibleData
    ar2 : AccumulatedRevertibleData

    an1 : AccumulatedNonRevertibleData
    an2 : AccumulatedNonRevertibleData

    c: CombinedAccumulatedData


    state Kernel {
    [*] --> PrivateKernelTail
    note left of PrivateKernelTail : compute *_gas_used for each set
    PrivateKernelTail --> ar1: contains *_gas_used
    PrivateKernelTail --> an1: contains *_gas_used

    ar1 --> PublicKernel
    an1 --> PublicKernel
    PublicKernel --> ar2
    PublicKernel --> an2
    note left of PublicKernel : PublicKernel forwards *_gas_used
    }

    state TypeScript {

    ar2 --> c
    an2 --> c
    c --> BaseRollup: contains *_gas_used
    note left of c : sum *_gas_used
    }

    state Kernel {
      BaseRollup  --> [*]
    }

```

## Future work

After [#5013](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/5013) is fixed, a possible configuration is:

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state has_public <<choice>>

    ar1 : AccumulatedRevertibleData
    ar2 : AccumulatedRevertibleData

    an1 : AccumulatedNonRevertibleData
    an2 : AccumulatedNonRevertibleData


    state Kernel {
    [*] --> PrivateKernelInner
    PrivateKernelInner --> has_public
    has_public --> PrivateKernelTailToRollup : no public component
    has_public --> PrivateKernelTailToPublic : has public component
    note left of PrivateKernelTailToPublic : partition sets and compute *_gas_used for each
    PrivateKernelTailToPublic --> ar1: contains *_gas_used
    PrivateKernelTailToPublic --> an1: contains *_gas_used

    ar1 --> PublicKernel
    an1 --> PublicKernel
    PublicKernel --> ar2
    PublicKernel --> an2
    note left of PublicKernel : PublicKernel accumulates *_gas_used

    ar2 --> PublicKernelTail
    an2 --> PublicKernelTail
    note left of PublicKernelTail : recombine and sum *_gas_used
    PublicKernelTail --> BaseRollup: contains *_gas_used

    PrivateKernelTailToRollup --> BaseRollup: contains *_gas_used


    BaseRollup  --> [*]
    }

```
