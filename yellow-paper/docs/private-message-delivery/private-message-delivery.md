# Private Message Delivery

## Requirements

Maintaining the core tenet of privacy within the Aztec Network imposes a number of requirements related to the transfer of notes from one user to another. If Alice executes a function that generates a note for Bob:

1. Alice will need to encrypt that note such that Bob, and only Bob is able to decrypt it.
2. Alice will need to broadcast the encrypted note so as to make it available for Bob to retrieve.
3. Alice will need to broadcast a 'tag' alongside the encrypted note. This tag must be identifiable by Bob's chosen [note discovery protocol](./note-discovery.md) but not identifiable by any third party.

Fulfilling these requirements will enable users to privately identify, retrieve, decrypt and consume their application notes.

## Constraining Message Delivery

The network will constrain:

1. The encryption of a user's note.
2. The generation of the tag for that note.
3. The publication of that note to the correct data availability layer.

Constraining [note encryption](./encryption-and-decryption.md) and tagging will be done through protocol defined functions within a user's account contract. The advantages of this approach are:

1. It enables a user to select their preferred [note discovery protocol](./note-discovery.md) and/or encryption scheme.
2. It ensures that notes are correctly encrypted with a user's public encryption key.
3. It ensures that notes are correctly tagged for a user's chosen [note discovery protocol](./note-discovery.md) .
4. It provides scope for upgrading these functions or introducing new schemes as the field progresses.
5. It protects applications from malicious account contracts providing unprovable functions.

> Note: Constraining tag generation is not solely about ensuring that the generated tag is of the correct format. It is also necessary to constrain that the generated tag is the next expected tag in the sequence of tags between two users. A tag sequence with duplicate or missing tags makes it much more difficult for the recipient to retrieve their notes. This will likely require tags to be nullified.

Constraining publication to the correct data availability layer will be performed via a combination of the protocol circuits and the rollup contract on L1.

## User Handshaking

One function that is useful regardless of a user's preferred note discovery and encryption scheme is for users to be notified when they have been sent a note from another user for the first time. To facilitate this we will deploy a 'handshake' contract that can be used to create a private note for a recipient containing the sender's information (e.g. public key). It should only be necessary for a single handshake to take place between two users. The notes generated by this contract will be easy to identify enabling users to retrieve these notes, decrypt them and use the contents in any deterministic tag generation used by their chosen note discovery protocol. Finding these handshake notes will be a matter of trial decryption but they should be easy to identify making such decryption feasible.
