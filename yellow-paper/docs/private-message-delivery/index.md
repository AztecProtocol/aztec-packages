<!--
Review notes for this chapter:
- Define "tagging", and briefly explain the motivation behind tagging. Why do we tag, instead of just emit the ciphertext for brute-force discovery? Jay did a good write up to justify tagging - I wonder if we can extract the essence from that (in a very condensed explanation)? Maybe tagging needs a short page of its own?
