# Build System

This repository uses a custom build system that is **agnostic to CI platforms** and **leverages a remote cache** (S3 or MinIO) for caching build artifacts. Our approach enables efficient incremental builds, distributed parallel testing, and consistent deployment to ephemeral infrastructure (e.g., AWS Spot Instances).

We avoid heavy CI vendor lock-in by using shell scripts with a uniform framework (ci3 folder). Each project defines its own bootstrap or build script but relies on the shared `ci3` folder for advanced features like:

- Generating **content hashes** to skip unchanged builds
- Uploading/downloading build artifacts
- Parallelizing & caching test results
- Logging ephemeral output
- Provisioning ephemeral AWS instances for maximum compute at minimal cost

## Requirements & Rationale

1. **Monorepo-friendly**
   Multiple projects within one repository can have separate build steps that only rebuild if their subset of files changes.

2. **Remote Caching**
   A stateless approach using S3-compatible storage (AWS S3 or MinIO). This replaces older Docker-image-based caches, streamlines artifact reuse, and easily shares builds across different runners or machines.

3. **Content-based Rebuilds**
   We compare content-hashes of relevant files. If no changes, no rebuild. This encourages fine-grained patterns (e.g., ignoring docs changes, but not ignoring new code).

4. **Ephemeral Infrastructure**
   We frequently run on EC2 spot instances to take advantage of cost savings. On eviction, the system gracefully shuts down and requeues tasks if needed.

5. **Avoiding CI Lock-In**
   We do *not* rely on special vendor features. Our build is run via shell scripts that can be triggered on any platform.

## Important Concepts

### Content Hashes
Instead of tagging artifacts by commit or branch, we compute a hash of the actual files that matter (via `.rebuild_patterns`). If code, dependencies, or scripts in that set change, we produce a new content hash and thus trigger a fresh build.

### CI-Agnostic
All logic is in shell scripts, grouped under the **ci3** folder. A minimal layer of environment detection handles toggling debug modes, caches, or ephemeral logs. This means the same build system can run on local machines, ephemeral Docker containers, or GitHub Actions.

### Rebuild Patterns
Each project folder often contains a `.rebuild_patterns` file. This file has patterns that, if matched by changed files, triggers a new build. Typical patterns might include: `^barretenberg/cpp/src/.*.cpp` and other patterns from root.

When `cache_content_hash` sees new changes in these paths, it regenerates a new hash which prevents a cache download until an S3 artifact with that hash is uploaded.

### Tools

Tools are provieded for the following themes.

1. **Caching**
   - **`cache_content_hash`**: Takes file patterns (or `.rebuild_patterns`) to compute a stable content hash.
   - **`cache_upload`, `cache_download`**: Upload/download `.tar.gz` artifacts from a remote S3-like cache.
   - **`cache_upload_flag`, `cache_download_flag`**: Mark or detect a particular test's success state. Avoids re-running long tests.

2. **Test Parallelization & Caching**
   - **`parallelise`**: Reads test commands from STDIN, executes in parallel, aggregates logs.
   - **`run_test_cmd`**: Single test runner that can skip tests cached as “already passed.”
   - **`filter_cached_test_cmd`**: Filters out test commands known to have succeeded (based on flags in redis).

3. **Ephemeral Logging**
   - **`denoise`**: Minimizes output spam; prints dots for each line, reveals full logs only if a command fails.
   - **`cache_log`**, **`dump_fail`**: Captures output for ephemeral storage and prints or reveals logs when needed.

4. **AWS Provisioning**
   - **`aws_request_instance`** & **`aws_terminate_instance`**: Provision ephemeral spot or on-demand instances.
   - **`aws_handle_evict`**: Detects spot-instance eviction signals, handles graceful shutdown or requeue.

5. **Docker Isolation**
   - **`docker_isolate`**: Executes a script in a new Docker container with ephemeral volumes, isolating host environment from side effects.

6. **General Utilities**
   - **`source_bootstrap`, `source_refname`, `source_color`**: Shared environment, color-coded logging, or version detection.
   - **`echo_header`**: Prints a heading for better log readability.
   - **ci3/source** is the central include-script for Aztec’s build system, automatically configuring Bash strict mode, setting up your $PATH to include all ci3 utilities (e.g. caching, parallel test commands), and providing helper functions and color-coded logging. Simply add source $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/ci3/source at the top of any project script to inherit a robust, preconfigured environment.

### Usage Flow

1. **In each project**: A `bootstrap.sh` might:
   - Call `cache_content_hash` to detect changes.
   - If changed, do the relevant compile step, then `cache_upload`.
   - If not changed, do `cache_download` to restore a previously built artifact.

2. **In test scripts**:
   - We gather test commands (`test_cmds`) in a form easily read by `parallelise`.
   - `parallelise` calls `run_test_cmd` on each line, skipping or running tests as needed.

3. **In local or ephemeral servers**:
   - Either manually run `./bootstrap.sh fast` or let the CI invoke it on a fresh machine.
   - The system pulls dependencies, attempts to restore from remote caches, rebuilds only if necessary, then parallelizes tests.

4. **On success**:
   - Artifacts can be re-uploaded or flagged as “passed,” letting future runs skip unchanged steps.
