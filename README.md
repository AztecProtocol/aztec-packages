## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Setup

1. **Full Setup:** Run `bootstrap.sh full` in the project root to initialize your environment.
   - Updates git submodules, downloads ignition transcripts, installs Foundry, compiles Solidity contracts, installs the current node version via `nvm`, and builds all TypeScript packages.
   - Requires [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions.

2. **Fast Setup:** Run `./bootstrap.sh fast` for a quicker setup focused on Noir contracts and TypeScript. This downloads builds for Barretenberg and Nargo from the CI cache. _Note: Requires AWS ECR credentials and works only on Ubuntu._

## üöÄ Continuous Integration

- **CI System:** This repository uses CircleCI for continuous integration. Build steps are managed using the [build-system](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/build-system) repository.
- **Docker Builds:** Packages are built in Docker; small packages are tested in Docker, while larger packages and end-to-end tests are run on AWS spot instances.
- **Debugging CI:** You can create a persistent SSH session on CircleCI by selecting "Rerun step with SSH" for debugging.

For more details on CI configurations, refer to the [build-system README](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/build-system).

---

## üõ† Debugging

All logging goes through the [DebugLogger module](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/yarn-project/foundation/src/log/debug.ts). Set a `DEBUG` environment variable to the module name (e.g., `aztec:*`) to enable detailed logs.

## üì¶ Releases

Releases are automated with [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please), which creates a 'Release PR' with an updated `CHANGELOG.md`. Merging this PR triggers a GitHub workflow to create a tagged release and deploy it through CircleCI.

## üîÑ Syncing Noir

Aztec uses [git-subrepo](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo) to manage a mirror of Noir. If syncing issues arise, follow these steps to recover:
- Manually edit `.gitrepo` file to match the commit in the master branch after merges.
- For further issues, refer to the [git-subrepo documentation](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo).

## üåç Earthly

[Earthly](https://docs.earthly.dev/) is a reproducible build tool used in this project. It combines Docker, Makefiles, and Bash functionalities to create modular and reusable build scripts.

- **Docker-Based:** Leverages Docker for caching and reproducibility.
- **CI-Compatible:** Supports both CI and local incremental builds.
- **Cross-Platform:** Currently, only Linux and WASM are supported.

For more examples, see the `Earthfile` in `barretenberg/cpp`.
