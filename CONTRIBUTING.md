# Contributing Guidelines

There are many ways to contribute to Aztec Monorepo.

Please read our [disclaimer](./DISCLAIMER.md) first

## Opening an issue

You can [open an issue] to suggest a feature or report a minor bug.

Before opening an issue, be sure to search through the existing open and closed issues, and consider posting a comment in one of those instead.

When requesting a new feature, include as many details as you can, especially around the use cases that motivate it. Features are prioritized according to the impact they may have on the ecosystem, so we appreciate information showing that the impact could be high.

## Submitting a pull request

If your contribution addresses a real issue and is well-structured, it is welcome. If in doubt, discuss with the team in an issue first your planned changes. Due to past abuses (e.g., metric-farming and AI-generated submissions), we reserve the right to block users who repeatedly submit low-effort or trivial content without meaningful improvements, as well as disruptive actions like excessively trying to get the attention of the team, on GitHub or elsewhere. Low-effort submissions will generally be redone regardless to dissuade metric farming.

If you would like to contribute code or documentation you may do so by forking the repository and submitting a pull request.

For non-trivial changes, start an issue first and discuss it with maintainers (see [Opening an issue](#opening-an-issue)).

If you're looking for a good place to start, look for issues labeled ["good first issue"](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/labels/good%20first%20issue). Please first communicate that you wish to take it on.

## Pull request checklist:

- I've provided a paragraph or two giving a summary of the change in the description, including relevant motivation and context.
- I've enabled auto-merge if the PR is ready to merge.
- I have updated the protocol specs in the docs (aka the yellow paper) when making changes to associated functionality (e.g. outward-facing spec changes).
- I have reviewed my diff in github, line by line and removed unexpected formatting changes, testing logs, or commented-out code.
- Every change is related to the PR description.
- I have [linked](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) this pull request to relevant issues (if any exist).
