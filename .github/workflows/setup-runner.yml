# Start cheap (~1/8th the cost of on demand, ~13th the cost of large GA runners) spot builders
# just for the CI job. These are specced per user and run the entire CI.
# TODO These have a persistent EBS volume that forms a fast-online docker image cache (used by Earthly), meaning
# TODO build steps that ran in previous invocations are quickly ran from cache.
