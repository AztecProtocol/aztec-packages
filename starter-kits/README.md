# Aztec Starter Kits

A collection of projects that act as starter kits for Aztec.
These depend on aztec.js and aztec.nr, and point to the monorepos local development versions.
When they're mirrored to their own repository (not done yet), they will be productionized with fixed versions of
dependencies located on npm and github.
These projects depend on the sandbox. They're built and tested after the sandbox by docker compose files.
