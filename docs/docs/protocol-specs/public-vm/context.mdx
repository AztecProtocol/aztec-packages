# Execution Context

An **execution context** contains the information and state relevant to a contract call's execution. When a contract call is made, an execution context is [initialized](#context-initialization) before the contract code's execution begins.

#### _AvmContext_
| Field                                                     | Type                    |
| ---                                                       | ---                     |
| environment                                               | `ExecutionEnvironment`  |
| [machineState](./state#machine-state)                     | `MachineState`          |
| [worldState](./state#avm-world-state)                     | `AvmWorldState`         |
| [worldStateAccessTrace](./state#world-state-access-trace) | `WorldStateAccessTrace` |
| [accruedSubstate](./state#accrued-substate)               | `AccruedSubstate`       |
| results                                                   | `ContractCallResults`   |

## Execution Environment

A context's **execution environment** remains constant throughout a contract call's execution. When a contract call initializes its execution context, it [fully specifies the execution environment](#context-initialization).

### _ExecutionEnvironment_
| Field                 | Type                         | Description |
| ---                   | ---                          | ---         |
| address               | `AztecAddress`               |  |
| storageAddress        | `AztecAddress`               |  |
| origin                | `AztecAddress`               |  |
| sender                | `AztecAddress`               |  |
| portal                | `EthAddress`                 |  |
| feePerL1Gas           | `field`                      |  |
| feePerL2Gas           | `field`                      |  |
| feePerDaGas           | `field`                      |  |
| contractCallDepth     | `field`                      | Depth of the current call (how many nested calls deep is it). |
| contractCallPointer   | `field`                      | Uniquely identifies each contract call processed by an AVM session. An initial call is assigned pointer value of 1 (expanded on in the AVM circuit section's ["Call Pointer"](./avm-circuit#call-pointer) subsection). |
| globals               | `PublicGlobalVariables`      |  |
| isStaticCall          | `boolean`                    |  |
| isDelegateCall        | `boolean`                    |  |
| calldata              | `[field; <calldata-length>]` |  |

## Contract Call Results

When a contract call halts, it sets the context's **contract call results** to communicate results to the caller.

### _ContractCallResults_
| Field        | Type                       | Description |
| ---          | ---                        | ---         |
| reverted     | `boolean`                  |  |
| output       | `[field; <output-length>]` |  |

## Context initialization

### Initial contract calls

An **initial contract call** initializes a new execution context from a public execution request.

```
context = AvmContext {
    environment = INITIAL_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT,
    machineState = INITIAL_MACHINE_STATE,
    worldState = <latest world state>,
    worldStateAccessTrace = INITIAL_WORLD_STATE_ACCESS_TRACE,
    accruedSubstate =  { [], ... [], }, // all substate vectors empty
    results = INITIAL_CONTRACT_CALL_RESULTS,
}
```

> Since world state persists between transactions, the latest state is injected into a new AVM context.

Given a [`PublicCallRequest`](../transactions/tx-object#public-call-request) and its parent [`TxRequest`](../transactions/local-execution#execution-request), these above-listed "`INITIAL_*`" entries are defined as follows:

```
INITIAL_EXECUTION_ENVIRONMENT = ExecutionEnvironment {
    address: PublicCallRequest.contractAddress,
    storageAddress: PublicCallRequest.CallContext.storageContractAddress,
    origin: TxRequest.origin,
    sender: PublicCallRequest.CallContext.msgSender,
    portal: PublicCallRequest.CallContext.portalContractAddress,
    feePerL1Gas: TxRequest.feePerL1Gas,
    feePerL2Gas: TxRequest.feePerL2Gas,
    feePerDaGas: TxRequest.feePerDaGas,
    contractCallDepth: 0,
    contractCallPointer: 1,
    globals: <current block's global variables>
    isStaticCall: PublicCallRequest.CallContext.isStaticCall,
    isDelegateCall: PublicCallRequest.CallContext.isDelegateCall,
    calldata: PublicCallRequest.args,
}

INITIAL_MACHINE_STATE = MachineState {
    l1GasLeft: TxRequest.l1GasLimit,
    l2GasLeft: TxRequest.l2GasLimit,
    daGasLeft: TxRequest.daGasLimit,
    pc: 0,
    internalCallStack: [], // initialized as empty
    memory: [0, ..., 0],   // all 2^32 entries are initialized to zero
}

INITIAL_WORLD_STATE_ACCESS_TRACE = WorldStateAccessTrace {
    accessCounter: 1,
    contractCalls: [ // initial contract call is traced
        TracedContractCall {
            callPointer: nestedContext.environment.callPointer,
            address: nestedContext.address,
            storageAddress: nestedContext.storageAddress,
            counter: 0,
            endLifetime: 0, // The call's end-lifetime will be updated later if it or its caller reverts
        }
    ],
    [], ... [], // remaining entries are empty
},

INITIAL_CONTRACT_CALL_RESULTS = ContractCallResults {
    reverted = false,
    output = [], // initialized as empty
}
```
