# Instruction Set

This page lists all of the instructions supported by the Aztec Virtual Machine (AVM).

The following notes are relevant to the table and sections below:
- `M[offset]` notation is shorthand for `context.machineState.memory[offset]`
- `S[slot]` notation is shorthand for an access to the specified slot in the current contract's public storage (`context.worldState.publicStorage`) after the slot has been siloed by the storage address (`hash(context.environment.storageAddress, slot)`)
- Any instruction whose description does not mention a program counter change simply increments it: `context.machineState.pc++`
- All instructions update `context.machineState.*GasLeft` as detailed in ["Gas limits and tracking"](./execution#gas-checks-and-tracking)
- Any instruction can lead to an exceptional halt as specified in ["Exceptional halting"](./execution#exceptional-halting)
- The term `hash` used in expressions below represents a Poseidon hash operation.
- Type structures used in world state tracing operations are defined in ["Type Definitions"](./type-structs)
