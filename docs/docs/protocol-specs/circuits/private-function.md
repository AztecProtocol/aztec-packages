# Private Function Circuit

## Requirements

Private function circuits represent smart contract functions that can: privately read and modify leaves of the note hash tree and nullifier tree; perform computations on private data; and can be executed without revealing which function or contract has been executed.

The logic of each private function circuit is tailored to the needs of a particular application or scenario, but the public inputs of every private function circuit _must_ adhere to a specific format. This specific format (often referred to as the "public inputs ABI for private functions") ensures that the [private kernel circuits](./private-kernel-initial.mdx) can correctly interpret the actions of every private function circuit.

## Private Inputs

The private inputs of a private function circuit are customizable.

## Public Inputs

<!-- Mike review: Perhaps we could also do one big class diagram which shows how all the structs (for all circuits) interrelate (similar to Lasse's diagrams in the 'Rollup Circuits' section)? -->

<!-- Mike review:
- Elaborate on what the `counter`s are for (or link to a section which describes them).
- It would be nice to explain what's inside a call_stack_item_hash, or to link to a definition of the private_call_stack_item and public_call_stack_item structs.
- It seems the L1->L2 messages tree doesn't exist anymore (according to the `../state/*` section of this paper. Perhaps it's been absorbed into the note hashes tree?). Consider updating the structs accordingly. EDIT: it should still exist.
- I think there's still some outstanding ugliness originating from the "where to read?" debate:
    - Read requests for notes are being output by private functions, but the `note_hash_tree_root` is also available - so which should be used by an app?
    - Read requests for the other trees aren't possible with the ABI, which implies all other reads would be have to be done inside the app circuit.
        - How feasible / ugly would it even be to enable the kernel circuit to process read requests of any historical data?
    - Is it possible to align the `BlockHeader` definition with the `Header` struct defined in `../rollup_circuits/base_rollup.md`?
    - I haven't read the kernel sections yet (I'll get there), but how does the kernel circuit link a note and nullifier together, to squash them both? There's no "pointer" from a nullifier to a note?
- TODO: consider whether we need a 'batched_call: bool` in the `CallContext`, and similarly whether we need a new call stack for pushing new batched call requests. (See the section `../calls/batched_calls.md` for some thinking that Palla has done on this subject.)
- TODO: Lasse has been considering whether `portal_contract_address` is unnecessary. He was pushing for L2 functions to be able to send a message to any L1 function. Catch up w/ Lasse.
- In addition to `msg_sender`, do we also need a `tx_origin`? I know this question often arises when considering how to spend escrowed notes if `msg.sender` is a non-human smart contract (which cannot possess nullifier secrets). In such cases, only `tx.origin` is a human capable of possessing secrets. Having said all that, there are patterns such as authwit and using 'secrets' instead of 'nullifier secrets' that have been proposed.
- Consider whether any types should be changed from `field`. (Presumably it would be less efficient to do so. Things like the preimage lengths could be something like a u32, for example).
- Consider whether args and return values should use the data bus, instead of being hashed.
- Consider whether logs should use the data bus, instead of being hashed. This would save sha256 computations on the client side. Instead, the entire data bus of logs could be forwarded to the sequencer who could sha256 them instead. Sometimes the data bus will need to be 'reset', in which case the user would need to call a special reset circuit to sha256-compress the logs.
- We'll need to add fields for requesting key derivation, using the user's master key(s). Done for nullifiers now. Still pending for outgoing viewing keys (we might be able to use the same interface for both and just rename it).
- Possibly mad suggestion: should the public inputs struct contain further nested structs: call_context, args_hash, return_values, read_requests, side_effects: { note_hashes, nullifiers, l2_to_l1_messages, logs: { unencrypted_log_hashes, encrypted_log_hashes, encrypted_note_preimage_hashes }, call_stacks: { private..., public... } }, block_header, globals: { chain_id, version }. It's up to you circuit writers :)

Some tweaks might be needed following this discussion: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12Fk0oTvj-yHbdnAkMnu0ymsDqCOEXLdmAxdVB5T_Y3Q/edit#gid=0

After generating a proof for a private function circuit, that proof (and associated public inputs) will be passed-into a private kernel circuit as private inputs. Private kernel circuits use the private function's proof, public inputs, and verification key, to verify the correct execution of the private function. Private kernel circuits then perform a number of checks and computations on the private function's public inputs.
