## The world's encrypted ledger

Our vision is to create a fairer, more open financial eco-system, built with encryption at its core.

We believe decentralization is premised on individual rights — without widely accessible encryption, we compromise our ability to choose how we live our lives and earn our livelihoods.

We are building the [Aztec Network](https://aztec.network/), a fully programmable private [ZK-rollup](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/) on [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) to enable developers to create decentralized applications with encryption and scale.

## Values

- **Private.**: The only true zero-knowledge rollup, built with a privacy-first UTXO architecture to allow developers to build privacy preserving programable applications.
- **Accessible.**: Proving transaction validity via recursively aggregation of zero-knowledge proofs, significantly reduces transaction costs.
- **Compliant**: The programmable nature of Aztec smart contracts, enables dApp developers to code privacy-preserving audit and compliance checks into apps, while fully preserving a credible neutral protocol layer.

#### _Zac Williamson, CEO and Co-founder, Aztec_

> “When we started Aztec, the technology to scale blockchains privately didn’t exist. Since then, we’ve assembled a team of world-class cryptographers who continuously redefine the state-of-the-art. Inventing PLONK — the paradigm-defining universal zk-SNARK — showcases our ability to produce technology that matches our ambitions: unlocking an entire universe of blockchain applications that couldn’t exist without privacy.”

To achieve these goals, we are pioneering the cryptography and research needed to bring our next generation, privacy-preserving zk-roll-up to mainnet.
