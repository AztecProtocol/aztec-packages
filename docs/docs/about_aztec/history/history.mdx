## Bitcoin

The original blockchain.

**Programmability**:

- None.
- Transfer bitcoin only.

**Privacy**:

- None.

---

## Ethereum

**Programmability**:

- Turing complete smart contracts.

**Privacy**:

- Originally: None.
- Now:
  - some specific apps on L1
  - some specific apps, deployed via L2, like zk.money and Aztec Connect.

---

## ZCash

**Programmability**:

- None.
- Transfer ZCash only.

**Privacy**:

- Transfers of shielded zcash are private.

---

## zk.money

**Programmability**:

- Any custom ERC20 token (on Ethereum L1) can be deposited to L2, transferred within L2, and withdrawn from L2.

**Privacy**:

- Transfers of the ERC20 tokens within the L2 are private.

---

## Aztec Connect

**Programmability**:

- The functionality of zk.money, plus:
- Tokens can be sent from the L2 shielded pool to many L1 DeFi contracts, and the resulting tokens can be re-shielded. This gives anonymity to L1 DeFi users.

**Privacy**:

- Transfers of the ERC20 tokens within the L2 are private.
- User DeFi interactions are anonymous.

---

## Aztec

**Programmability**:

- Fully programmable private smart contracts:
  - Private functions which can edit general private state
  - Cheap L2 public functions
  - L1 (public) functions.

**Privacy**:

- Executing private functions grants:
  - Function privacy
  - Input privacy
  - User privacy
- Executing a private function which calls a public function grants varying degrees of privacy, depending on the application someone deploys. (Similar to how deposits and withdrawals to/from shielded pools can leak privacy).
