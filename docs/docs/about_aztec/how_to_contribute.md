Decentralization is one of our core values, so we want to encourage participation as much as possible and in any way you can.

## Improve the protocol

- Anyone can open an Issue, so please feel free to create one

## Grants

- The Aztec Labs Grants Program supports developers building with, and contributing to, the Noir programming language and the Aztec network. Applications can submitted on the [Grants page](https://aztec.network/grants/) of the Aztec website. 
- The most recent grants wave closed at the end of 2023. However, we will continue funding retroactive grants, even if a grants wave is not strictly open at the time of submission.
