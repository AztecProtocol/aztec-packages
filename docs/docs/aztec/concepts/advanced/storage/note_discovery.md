Note discovery refers to the process of a [PXE](../../pxe/index.md) finding the notes that it owns, ie the notes it is able to decrypt. 

Aztec utilizes a note tagging scheme that allows users to register an expected note sender in their PXE. This tells the PXE to expect notes coming from that expected sender, which helps more efficiently discover the encrypted notes being created for its registered accounts.
