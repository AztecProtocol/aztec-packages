title: Public Kernel Circuit
---

This circuit is executed by a Sequencer, since only a Sequencer knows the current state of the [public data tree](../../storage/trees/index.md#public-state-tree) at any time. A Sequencer might choose to delegate proof generation to the Prover pool.

Read more about the public kernel circuits in the protocol specs [here](../../../../protocol-specs/circuits/private-kernel-tail).
