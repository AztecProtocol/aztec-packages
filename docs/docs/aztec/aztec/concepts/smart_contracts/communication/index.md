This section will walk over communication types that behaves differently than normal function calls.

Namely, if functions are in different domains, private vs. public, their execution behaves a little differently to what you might expect! See [Private \<--\> Public execution](./public_private_calls.md).

Read the protocol specification about Cross-chain communication between Aztec and Ethereum [here](../../../../../protocol-specs/l1-smart-contracts/index.md).
