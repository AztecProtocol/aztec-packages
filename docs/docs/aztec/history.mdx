# A brief history of blockchain privacy

<Image img={require("/img/comparison.png")} />

## Bitcoin

The original blockchain.

**Programmability**:  
None.  
Transfer bitcoin only.

**Privacy**:  
None.

## Ethereum

**Programmability**:  
Turing complete smart contracts.

**Privacy**:  
Originally: None.  
Now: some specific apps, deployed via L2, like zk.money and Aztec Connect (see below).

## ZCash

**Programmability**:  
None.  
Transfer ZCash only.

**Privacy**:  
Transfers of shielded zcash are private.

## zk.money

**Programmability**:  
Any custom ERC20 token (on Ethereum L1) can be deposited to L2, transferred within L2, and withdrawn from L2.

**Privacy**:  
Transfers of the ERC20 tokens within the L2 are private.

## Aztec Connect

**Programmability**:  
The functionality of zk.money, plus:  
Tokens can be sent from the L2 shielded pool to many L1 defi contracts, and the resulting tokens can be re-shielded. This gives anonymity to L1 defi users.

**Privacy**:  
Transfers of the ERC20 tokens within the L2 are private.  
User defi interactions are anonymous.

## Aztec

**Programmability**:  
Fully programmable private smart contracts:

- private functions which can edit general private state
- cheap L2 public functions
- L1 (public) functions.

**Privacy**:  
Executing private functions grants:

- Function privacy
- Input privacy
- User anonymity

Executing a private function which calls a public function grants varying degrees of privacy, depending on the application someone deploys. (Similar to how deposits and withdrawals to/from shielded pools can leak privacy).
