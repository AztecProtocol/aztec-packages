import Disclaimer from '../common/\_disclaimer.mdx';

<Disclaimer/>

See [here](./) for draft milestones.

See [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1riqr23R-VOAwOAzpgRj40tsAfq0ZA5yO/view?usp=share_link) for an unfinished (but maybe helpful) contract deployment sequence diagram, and other tabs for other useful diagrams.

See [here](../protocol/contract-creation) for more on Contract Creation.

## Reminder of the milestone:

> As a developer, I can write a Noir++ contract scope, which contains a collection of pure functions (circuits) (no state variables yet).
>
> I can type `noir my_contract.nr` to compile a Noir contract to a JSON abi (or, hand craft the JSON abi).
>
> I can type `aztec-cli deploy_contract my_contract_abi.json` and have a contract deployed to my local network.
>
> I can type `aztec-cli get_code address` to verify my contract has been deployed successfully.

The aim is to keep the implementation _as simple as possible_. We want to achieve the appropriate state shift on L1, and avoid anything that feels like unnecessary boiler-plate, or just "vanilla engineering". We're avoiding databases, network io, optimisations etc. Most of the code in this milestone should be directly related to computing and making the requisite state shift, otherwise we maybe going out of scope.

## Further explanation:

It'll basically require the infrastructure needed to maintain the contracts tree, and the ability to construct and insert a leaf into it:

Note: some other data will also need to be broadcast as calldata on-chain, for data availability purposes. E.g. the ACIR opcodes of each newly-deployed contract.

## High Level Architecture

Greyed out components don't need to exist at all for this milestone, but basically everything will need to exist in some capacity (even if some parts are heavily simulated).

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJuHodIJn.png)

This spec uses `snake_case` for it's naming, however in the world of TypeScript we should adapt these names as appropriate to be `camelCase`.

## Communications Layer

Although we often speak about "JSON RPC", this is a transport layer concept, and is not actually needed for this milestone.

The various services and modules should be defined as TypeScript interfaces. Functions that take arguments and return results. We will start by just implementing these interfaces directly, and running the stack as a single monolith. We can then implement them as individual services a bit later by just auto-generating the JSON RPC http client code and server handlers. We have this pattern already between e.g. falafel and halloumi. Halloumi can just be run as a module within the falafel process, or run as a separate service.

## Proving System

There will be no proofs generated in early milestones. Functions that would normally build an actual proof can be skipped (or be no-ops). The simulators should produce output that is identical to a proof output, just without the actual proof data (e.g. just the `public_inputs`). The kernel simulator and rollup simulator, will use the exact same C++ circuit logic, only the simulator will use native machine types so it's fast.

## Thinking About State

The lowest level system state is represented by one or more streams of data. In AC this was the calldata and the off-chain data. Aztec will likely have it's state also represented as more than one stream of data. For this milestone we could just adopt a similar separation of data, although longer term some state might make it's way into [danksharding](https://ethereum.org/en/roadmap/danksharding/) blobs, and maybe some state won't go to the ethereum network at all.

Regardless, there should be a separation of concern between the stream of data, and how/where it's stored. Data should be stored unprocessed, in an implementation of a simple key-value store interface. So e.g. there maybe a component that when pointed at the rollup contract, stores the calldata for each rollup in a key-value implementation that just saves it to a file named by rollup number.

A higher level component can take those multiple streams of data, and reconcile them to produce another single stream of data, the full data to describe a single rollup. These tasks will be handled by the data archiver, allowing querying of the data archiver for rollups > n.

The Private Client will have different methods for acquiring the data needed to produce its own data streams (one stream of data per account, effectively filtering the full chain state down to just the events relevant to that account).

- Brute force.
- Nym message protocol.
- Oblivious Message retrieval.
- Hybrids and new wonderful things?

The output streams of these technologies are the same, making them interchangeable. This stream of data represents the state shifts from the perspective of a single account. For this milestone we will just brute force.

There are a few considerations to make when processing state:

- State events are immutable (save and forget, idempotent).
- New state events can arrive at any time (consumers need to wake-to-handle).
- It grows unbounded, meaning it won't scale to "load and process all state at once".
- Traditional stream/channel concepts lend themselves well to ingesting, transforming, and outputting state.

Think of something like "Go channels" in terms of design (our MemoryFifo was written to leverage this pattern). Whereas a stream is often thought of as a buffered stream of bytes, channels are more like a buffered stream of messages. The SDK in AC has an example of how to do this. The BlockDownloader is told to start from a certain block number. It will build up an internal buffer of rollups in its "channel" (queue) till it hits some limit. A consumer calls `getRollup` which will block until a rollup is returned. Thus the consumer can have simple "synchronous" control flow loop. The code can also then be run naturally against a fixed size data store (it would just never block). It can act as a simple transformer, ingesting a directory of files and outputting another directory of files. This should also make isolated unit testing simple.

From an account perspective, as we process the accounts data stream, we will need to process the data through a simulator to execute contract specific filtering logic. This kind of transform changes the stream of data events into a snapshot. The final data representation thus maybe a set of key-values where a key is a storage slot, and a value maybe e.g. the sum of all UTXOs (the accounts balance).

The takeaway of this is to not get carried away with high level databases and indexes at this point, but to think of data as streams of data with simple low level representations. The transformations should be simple, modular, easily testable, and reusable in different environments (via storage abstraction).

## Interfaces and Responsibilities

It's important to define some key concepts as interfaces. These can be categorised as either data, or logic based interfaces.

Data interfaces are about retrieving and/or updating state. By using the right abstractions, it will be possible to:

- Mock sources of data for use in unit/integration tests.
- Keep logic narrowly scoped to dealing with specific bits of data.
- Avoid dealing with databases for now.
- Take shortcuts that allow us to focus on protocol development and not get bogged down in privacy concerns. e.g:
  - Use a `SiblingPathSource` that just queries the remote `PublicClient` for a contracts sibling path.
  - This normally would be a privacy concern, but it may not be if:
    - Technologies like Nym work out over the longer term.
    - The dapp can provide the paths as they're immutable.
  - Otherwise we can substitute in a local cache of the contract tree at a later date.

Logic interfaces are about executing specific bits of functionality. By using the right abstractions it will be possible to:

- Mock and dependency inject functionality for use in unit/integration tests.
- Ignore the writing of network code for now.
- Allow complete flexibility in terms of which components run in process, and which become remote.
- Run the stack quickly as a monolith for development and integration testing.

## Module Implementation Notes

### Noir

These tasks are lower priority than providing a handcrafted ABI.

- The ability for a dev to enclose a collection of Noir functions in a 'contract scope'.
- The ability to create a Noir contract abi from the above.

Design a Noir Contract ABI, similar to a Solidity ABI which is output by Solc (see [here](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/abi-spec.html#json)). It might include for each function:

- ACIR opcodes (akin to Solidity bytecode).
- Function name and parameter names & types.
- Public input/output witness indices?
- Sourcemap information, allowing building of stack traces in simulator error cases.

### aztec-cli

Provides the `aztec-cli` binary for interacting with network from the command line. It's a thin wrapper around `aztec.js` to make calls out to the client services. It's stateless.

### aztec.js

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryRmLLL12.png)

Should provide sensible API, that provides the following functionalities. Start by writing the single e2e test that will check for the successful contract deployment. We don't need to get this perfect, but think hard about making the process feel very natural to a user of the library.

aztec.js should always be stateless. It offers the ability to interact with stateful systems such as the public and private clients.

The analogous AC component would be the AztecSdk (wraps the CoreSdk which is more analogous to the private client).

- Allows a user to create an Aztec keypair. Call `create_account` on Wallet.
- Create a `Contract` instance (similar to web3.js), given a path to a Noir Contract ABI.
- Construct `tx_request` by calling e.g. `contract.get_deployment_request(constructor_args)`.
- Call wallet `sign_tx_request(tx_request)` to get signature.
- Call `simulate_tx(signed_tx_request)` on the Private Client. In future this would help compute gas, for now we won't actually return gas (it's hard). Returns success or failure, so client knows if it should proceed, and computed kernel circuit public outputs.
- Call `create_tx(signed_tx_request)` on Private Client to produce kernel proof. Can be skipped for this milestone. In future should be able to generate either mock (few constraints) or real proof.
- Call `send_tx(tx)` on Private Client to send kernel proof to Public Client. Get back a receipt.
- Wait until the receipt is settled with repeated calls to `get_tx_receipt` on the Private Client.

### ethereum.js

L1 client library. No ethers.js. Uses our existing and new L1 client code.

### TestKeyStore

Interfaces Implemented:

- `KeyStore`

Implementation notes for this milestone:

- Exposes a single account, created by a private key given in the ctor, that defaults to some test key.
- Can be used as both the spending and decryption key for early development.

### AztecRpcServer (Previously Wallet/Private Client)

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/ryS0sOLyh.png)

Implements:

- `AztecRpcClient` (The server is a client, when used directly)

Injected:

- `KeyStore`

Implementation notes for this milestone:

- Avoid saving any state for now. Just resync from the `PublicClient` on startup.
- Avoid needing to sync the merkle trees for now. Just use `SiblingPathSource` that queries the paths from the `PublicClient`.
- `simulate_tx`
  - Can compute the contract's leaf (which will be inserted into the contract tree). See diagram linked at top of page.
  - Can spin-up a simulator instance for the constructor function.
    - (Note, executing an _interesting_ constructor function is not until the next milestone, but we still need to execute a no-op constructor function for a contract deployment, since the public inputs of the constructor carry some contract deployment info, and need to passed into the kernel circuit).
  - Simulator will check whether the tx will succeed. It will return all public inputs/outputs.
  - Can collect/generate additional data required for kernel circuit execution.
  - Can pass the fake constructor proof, public inputs, and other kernel circuit data into a kernel simulator.
  - Returns if the simulation succeeded, and the public inputs/outputs of the kernel circuit.
- `create_tx`
  - For this milestone, will just do the same as `simulate_tx`.
  - Returns a `tx` that can be sent to `send_tx` with everything but actual proof data.
- `send_tx`
  - Forwards the given tx to the Public Client.

### PublicClientImpl

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Sksg3u8kh.png)

Implements:

- `PublicClient`

Injected:

- `P2PClient`
- `RollupSource`
- `MerkleTreeDb`

Implementation notes for this milestone:

- Mostly acting as a facade for other components, forwards requests as necessary.
- A `WorldStateSynchroniser` will ingest rollups from the `RollupSource` and maintain an up-to-date `MerkleTreeDb`.

<!--
Mikes bullets. Some of these in wrong place (sequencer does publishing)
- Can simulate & generate a rollup proof (1x1). (See below for section on rollup logic).
- Can submit the rollup proof to the rollup contract.
- Can sync from the rollup contract.
    - Note: syncing will only mean syncing the contract tree at this milestone.
- Can maintain a contract tree which reflects what's happened on the rollup contract.
    - The contract tree is an append-only tree.
- Can maintain “tree of contract tree roots”, much like we had for the data tree in Aztec Connect. This means clients can reference “old” contract tree roots when generating proofs, in the event the contract tree updates asynchronously. The tree of roots only needs to be of size e.g. 128, to ensure there is a large enough “window of time”.
- Can maintain a DB of all code (ACIR) which has been deployed to the contract tree, along with the contract's constructor args, and the contract's address and contract leaf's index.
- Can receive json-rpc requests from the Private Client and/or from aztec.js:
    - `get_code` - to get details about the contract code deployed at a particular address (or, differently, a particular leaf of the contract tree).
-->

### MemoryP2PClient

Implements:

- `P2PClient`

Injected:

- `RollupSource`
- `MerkleTreeDb`

Implementation notes for this milestone:

- For this milestone there won't be any p2p network.
- Perform relevant validations possible in this milestone (e.g. check no tree conflicts, skip proof verification).
- Purge relevant txs from pool on rollup receipt.
- Store txs in an in memory map of txId -> tx.

### Sequencer Client

![](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hk823d81h.png)

Responsibilities:

- Wins a period of time to become the sequencer (depending on finalised protocol).
- Chooses a set of txs from the tx pool to be in the rollup.
- Simulate the rollup of txs.
- Adds proof requests to the request pool (not for this milestone).
- Receives results to those proofs from the network (repeats as necessary) (not for this milestone).
- Publishes L1 tx(s) to the rollup contract via `RollupPublisher`.

For this milestone, the sequencer will just simulate and publish a 1x1 rollup and publish it to L1.

### MerkleTreeDb

Implements:

- `SiblingPathSource`

Implementation notes for this milestone:

Closest analogous component in AC is the `WorldStateDb` in bb.js. We can configure the backing store (probably leveldb) to be an in-memory only store. We don't need persistence, we will rebuild the tree at startup. This will ensure we have appropriate sync-from-zero behaviour.

Responsibilities:

- "Persists" the various merkle trees (configurable).
  - For this milestone 1.1, we'll need the following trees:
    - Contract Tree
    - Contract Tree Roots Tree (the tree whose leaves are the roots of historic rollups' contract trees)
    - Nullifier Tree (so that the contract address can never be re-registered in a future deployment)
      - Note: Suyash has implemented C++ for the 'new' kind of nullifier tree.
- Provides methods for updating the trees with commit, rollback semantics.
- Provides methods for getting hash paths to leafs in the trees.

Interface:

- `get_root`
- `get_num_leaves`
- `get_sibling_path`
- `append_leaves`

### WorldStateSynchroniser

Injected:

- `RollupSource`
- `MerkleTreeDb`

Responsibilities:

- Receives new rollups from the `RollupSource` and updates trees in the `MerkleTreeDb`.

### Rollup Archiver

Implements:

- `RollupSource`

Responsibilities:

- Pulls data in from whatever sources are needed, to fully describe a rollup e.g.
  - L1 calldata (`provessRollup` and `offchainData` for this milestone.)
  - ETH blobs (not before they are released).
  - Other sources that have archived historical ETH blobs (not before they are released).
- Combines these sources of data to describe a `Rollup`.
- Can be queried for the rollup data.

Interface:

- `get_latest_rollup_id`
- `get_rollups(from, take)`

### Rollup Publisher

Implements:

- `RollupReceiver`

Implementation notes for this milestone:

- We can leverage most of the logic from Falafels old `RollupPublisher`.
- On receipt of a rollup, will publish to L1 and respond with success or failure.

### Rollup Smart Contract

Interface:

- `processRollup(proofData, l1Data)`
- `offchainData(data)`

Implementation notes for this milestone:

The rollup contract in AC holds data in two places that are reconciled when processing the rollup. The calldata passed into the `processRollup` function, and the calldata passed into the `offchainData` function. They were separated, as only the data given to `processRollup` is needed to ensure rollup liveness (i.e. if the "offchain data" were not published, we could still produce rollups). Ultimately the plan was to move the offchain data off of L1 altogether to reduce costs.

For this milestone, we will want to leverage a similar separation of data. The data to `processData` will consist of:

- `proofData` - The proof data to be fed to the verifier. Likely will have a public inputs that represent:
  - The hash of the data in the offchain data (should use whatever commitment scheme Eth Blobs will use).
  - Recursion point fields.
- `l1Data` - Data that is needed for making L2 - L1 function calls.

For logic:

- Can receive a rollup proof and verify it (verifier just returns true for this milestone).
- Can update the state hash (which would only represent an update to the contract tree, at this milestone).

For `offchainData`:

- Receives relevant calldata that needs to be broadcast. For contract deployment, this might be:
  - Acir opcodes.
  - Constructor arguments.
  - Contract address & contract leaf.

### Kernel Circuit functionality

- Can validate the signature of a signed tx object.
- Can verify a 'previous' mock kernel circuit (this code is already in there).
- Can verify the constructor function's proof (this functionality is already in there).
- Can check contract deployment logic. (Note: it won't contain checks for private circuit execution logic, as that's for a future milestone).

### Rollup Circuit functionality

- TODO: more discussion needed to understand exactly what's needed here.
- Can verify a kernel circuit proof
- Can compute the contract's address
- Can compute a 'nullifier' for the contract's address, to prevent it being used again (possibly defer this, because we don't want to care about a nullifier tree in this milestone).
- Can compute the contract leaf for the contract (see diagrams).
- Can insert the contract's leaf into the contract tree.
- Can insert the contract tree's root into a "tree of contract tree roots".
- ???? Verifies the ACIR Verification proof (see Contract Creation doc by Zac)

## Glossary

- `witness`: Any value within the circuit, by default these are private, and thus not visible on the proof. Some witnesses may be made public (visible on the proof), at which point they also become `public_inputs`.
- `[circuit_]input`: Data that is computed outside the circuit and is fed in at the beginning as a `witness`. Note: if the context of this relating to a 'circuit' is already clear, we can omit `circuit_`, as is done in the `aztec3_circuits` repo.
- `oracle_input`: Data that, during execution, is fetched from the oracle, and made a `witness`.
- `computed_public_input`: Data that is computed within the circuit, and set to be a `public_input`.
- `public_input`: Data that is set to be public by the circuit. This could include some `circuit_input` data, and/or some `computed_public_input` data, and/or some `oracle_input` data.
