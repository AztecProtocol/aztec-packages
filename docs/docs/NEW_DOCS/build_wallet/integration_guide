Accounts
AuthWits
Keys and addresses
note tagging
Modularised PXE
Fees and Gas and FPC integ (also refer to wallet RFP for content on chosing fpcs)
How do we expect dapps to connect to wallet and wallet connect
Authorization: https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/9128
Private RPC Queries
capsules


NOTE - almost all of this can be hyperlinked to specific parts in the protocol_concepts dir OR tailored to info wallets should know
I (rahul) think it should be former for easy maintenance. So engineering know what protocol concepts to change.
