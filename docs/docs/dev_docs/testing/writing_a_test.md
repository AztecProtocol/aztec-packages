Individual functions can be tested much like [how 'regular Noir' functions can be tested](https://noir-lang.org/nargo/testing).

But an Aztec.nr contract typically tracks state variables, so you'll likely need to write more complex tests in TypeScript, using Aztec.js. You can see how to do that in the [Dapp Testing tutorial](../dapps/tutorials/testing.md).
