# Errors

List common errors.

There are two kinds of errors: errors in an Aztec.nr contract, and errors spat out by an Aztec Sandbox node!

Maybe even auto-generate error docs, based on error codes in our codebase.

Make sure descriptions of errors relate to the end user experience. An error like 'SegFault' is useless to a contract developer!
