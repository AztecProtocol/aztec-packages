title: Oracle Functions

This page goes over what oracles are in Aztec and how they work. 

Looking for a practical guide? You can learn how to use oracles in a smart contract [here](../oracles.md).

An oracle is something that allows us to get data from the outside world into our contracts. The most widely-known types of oracles in blockchain systems are probably Chainlink price feeds, which allow us to get the price of an asset in USD taking non-blockchain data into account.

While this is one type of oracle, the more general oracle, allows us to get "some" data into the contract. In the context of oracle functions or oracle calls in Aztec, it can essentially be seen as user-provided arguments, that can be embedded at any point in the circuit, and thus don't need to be an input parameter.

**Why is this useful? Why don't just pass them as input parameters?**
In the world of EVM, you would just read the values directly from storage and call it a day. However, when we are working with circuits for private execution, this becomes more tricky as you cannot just read the storage directly from your state tree, only commitments sit in there ðŸ˜±. The pre-images (content) of your notes need to be provided to the function to prove that you actually allowed to spend them.

You could of course provide them to your function as inputs, but then functions that have different underlying notes would end up with different function signatures and thus selectors. This means that integrating with many different tokens (with different underlying notes) would become a pain for the developers, see some of the motivation behind [EIP-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) for similar case in EVM.

If we are instead fetching the notes using an oracle call, we can keep the function signature independent of the underlying notes and thus make it much easier to integrate with! A similar idea, but applied to the authentication mechanism is used for the Authentication Witnesses that allow us to have a single function signature for any wallet implementation making integrations a breeze, see [AuthWit](../../../wallets/main#authorizing-actions) for more information on this.

Oracles introduce **non-determinism** into a circuit, and thus are `unconstrained`. It is important that any information that is injected into a circuit through an oracle is later constrained for correctness. Otherwise, the circuit will be **under-constrained** and potentially insecure!

`Aztec.nr` has a module dedicated to its oracles. If you are interested, you can view them by following the link below:
