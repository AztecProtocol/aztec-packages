title: Events
---

Events in Aztec work similarly to Ethereum events in the sense that they are a way for contracts to communicate with the outside world.
They are emitted by contracts and stored inside each instance of an AztecNode.

:::info
Aztec events are currently represented as raw data and are not ABI encoded.
ABI encoded events are a feature that will be added in the future.
:::

Unlike on Ethereum, there are 2 types of events supported by Aztec: encrypted and unencrypted.

## Encrypted Events

Encrypted events can only be emitted by private functions and are encrypted using a public key of a recipient.
For this reason it is necessary to register a recipient in the Private Execution Environment (PXE) before encrypting the events for them.
Recipients can be registered using the Aztec CLI or Aztec.js:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="events">
<TabItem value="cli" label="Aztec CLI">

```bash
aztec-cli register-recipient --address 0x147392a39e593189902458f4303bc6e0a39128c5a1c1612f76527a162d36d529 --public-key 0x26e193aef4f83c70651485b5526c6d01a36d763223ab24efd1f9ff91b394ac0c20ad99d0ef669dc0dde8d5f5996c63105de8e15c2c87d8260b9e6f02f72af622 --partial-address 0x200e9a6c2d2e8352012e51c6637659713d336405c29386c7c4ac56779ab54fa7
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="Aztec.js">

```ts
const aztecAddress = AztecAddress.fromString(
  "0x147392a39e593189902458f4303bc6e0a39128c5a1c1612f76527a162d36d529"
);
const publicKey = Point.fromString(
  "0x26e193aef4f83c70651485b5526c6d01a36d763223ab24efd1f9ff91b394ac0c20ad99d0ef669dc0dde8d5f5996c63105de8e15c2c87d8260b9e6f02f72af622"
);
const partialAddress = Fr.fromString(
  "0x200e9a6c2d2e8352012e51c6637659713d336405c29386c7c4ac56779ab54fa7"
);

const completeAddress = CompleteAddress.create(
  aztecAddress,
  publicKey,
  partialKey
);
await pxe.registerRecipient(completeAddress);
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info
If a note recipient is one of the accounts inside the PXE, we don't need to register it as a recipient because we already have the public key available. You can register a recipient as shown [here](../deploying#deploying-private-token-contract)

At this point the Sandbox only enables the emitting of encrypted note preimages through encrypted events.
In the future we will allow emitting arbitrary information.
(If you currently emit arbitrary information, PXE will fail to decrypt, process and store this data, so it will not be queryable).
:::

To emit encrypted logs first import the `emit_encrypted_log` utility function which wraps an [oracle](./functions.md#oracle-functions):

#include_code encrypted_import /yarn-project/aztec-nr/address-note/src/address_note.nr rust

Then you can call the function:

#include_code encrypted /yarn-project/aztec-nr/address-note/src/address_note.nr rust

### Processing Encrypted Events

One of the functions of the PXE is constantly loading encrypted logs from the `AztecNode` and decrypting them.
When new encrypted logs are obtained, the PXE will try to decrypt them using the private encryption key of all the accounts registered inside PXE.
If the decryption is successful, the PXE will store the decrypted note inside a database.
If the decryption fails, the specific log will be discarded.

For the PXE to successfully process the decrypted note we need to compute the note's 'note hash' and 'nullifier'.
Aztec.nr enables smart contract developers to design custom notes, meaning developers can also customize how a note's note hash and nullifier should be computed. Because of this customizability, and because there will be a potentially-unlimited number of smart contracts deployed to Aztec, an PXE needs to be 'taught' how to compute the custom note hashes and nullifiers for a particular contract. Therefore, developers will need to implement a `compute_note_hash_and_nullifier` function inside their contracts.

:::danger
If your function has private state variables, you **MUST** include a `compute_note_hash_and_nullifier` function to allow the RPC to process encrypted events.
:::

Every time a new note is successfully decrypted, the PXE will expect the existence of a `compute_note_hash_and_nullifier` function, which must teach it how to correctly process the new note.

#include_code compute_note_hash_and_nullifier /yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/token_contract/src/main.nr rust


## Unencrypted Events

Unencrypted events are events which can be read by anyone.
They can be emitted by both public and private functions.

:::danger
- Emitting unencrypted events from private function is a significant privacy leak and it should be considered by the developer whether it is acceptable.
- Unencrypted events are currently **NOT** linked to the contract emitting them, so it is practically a [`debug_log`](./functions.md#a-few-useful-inbuilt-oracles).
:::

To emit unencrypted logs first import the `emit_unencrypted_log` utility function inside your contract:

#include_code unencrypted_import /yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/test_contract/src/main.nr rust

Then you can call the function:

#include_code emit_unencrypted /yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/test_contract/src/main.nr rust

Once emitted, unencrypted events are stored in AztecNode and can be queried by anyone:
<Tabs groupId="events">
<TabItem value="cli" label="Aztec CLI">

```bash
aztec-cli get-logs --fromBlock 5
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="js" label="Aztec.js">

#include_code get_logs /yarn-project/end-to-end/src/fixtures/utils.ts typescript

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Get logs functionality provides a variety of filtering options.
To display them run:

```bash
aztec-cli get-logs --help
```

## Costs

All event data is pushed to Ethereum as calldata by the sequencer and for this reason the cost of emitting an event is non-trivial.

In the Sandbox, an encrypted note has a fixed overhead of 4 field elements (to broadcast an ephemeral public key, a contract address, and a storage slot); plus a variable number of field elements depending on the type of note being emitted.

A `ValueNote`, for example, currently uses 3 fields elements (plus the fixed overhead of 4). That's roughly `7 * 32 = 224` bytes of information.

#include_code value-note-def /yarn-project/aztec-nr/value-note/src/value_note.nr

- There are plans to compress encrypted note data further.
- There are plans to adopt EIP-4844 blobs to reduce the cost of data submission further.
