## What is a portal

A portal is the point of contact between L1 and a specific contract on Aztec. For applications such as token bridges, this is the point where the tokens are are held on L1 while used in L2. 

As outlined in the [foundational concepts](../../../concepts/foundation/communication/cross_chain_calls.md), an Aztec L2 contract is linked to *ONE* L1 address at time of deployment (specified by the developer). This L1 address is the only address that can send messages to that specific L2 contract, and the only address that can receive messages sent from the L2 contract to L1. Note, that a portal don't actually need to be a contract, it could be any address on L1. We say that an Aztec contract is attached to a portal.

## Passing data to the rollup

Whether it is tokens or other information being passed to the rollup, the portal should use the [`Inbox`](./inbox.md) to do it.

The `Inbox` can be seen as a mailbox to the rollup, portals put messages into the box, and the sequencers then decide which of these message they want to include in their blocks (each message has a fee attached to it, so there is a fee market here).

When sending messages, we need to specify quite a bit of information beyond just the content that we are sharing. Namely we need to specify:

| Name           | Type    | Description |
| -------------- | ------- | ----------- |
| Recipient      | `L2Actor` | The message recipient. This **MUST** match the rollup version and an Aztec contract that is **attached** to the contract making this call. If the recipient is not attached to the caller, the message cannot be consumed by it. |
| Deadline       | `uint256` | The deadline for the message to be consumed. If the message has not been removed from the `Inbox` and included in a rollup block by this point, it can be *cancelled* by the portal (the portal must implement logic to cancel). |
| Content        | `field` (~254 bits) | The content of the message. This is the data that will be passed to the recipient. The content is limited to be a single field. If the content is small enough it can just be passed along, otherwise it should be hashed and the hash passed along (you can use our [`Hash`](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/l1-contracts/src/core/libraries/Hash.sol) utilities with `sha256ToField` functions)  |
| Secret Hash    | `field` (~254 bits)  | A hash of a secret that is used when consuming the message on L2. Keep this preimage a secret to make the consumption private. To consume the message the caller must know the pre-image (the value that was hashed) - so make sure your app keeps track of the pre-images! Use the [`computeMessageSecretHash`](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/yarn-project/aztec.js/src/utils/secrets.ts) to compute it from a secret. |
| Fee            | `uint64`  | The fee to the sequencer for including the message. This is the amount of ETH that the sequencer will receive for including the message. Note that it is not a full `uint256` but only `uint64`|

With all that information at hand, we can call the `sendL2Message` function on the Inbox. The function will return a `field` (inside  `bytes32`) that is the hash of the message. This hash can be used as an identifier to spot when your message has been included in a rollup block. 

#include_code send_l1_to_l2_message l1-contracts/src/core/interfaces/messagebridge/IInbox.sol solidity

As time passes, a sequencer will see your tx, the juicy fee provided and include it in a rollup block. Upon inclusion, it is removed from L1, and made available to be consumed on L2.

To consume the message, we can use the `consume_l1_to_l2_message` function within the `context` struct. 
- The `msg_key` is the hash of the message returned by the `sendL2Message` call and is used to help the RPC find the correct message. 
- The `content` is the content of the message, limited to one Field element. For content larger than one Field, we suggest using the `sha256` hash function truncated to a single Field element. `sha256` is suggested as it is cheap on L1 while still being managable on L2. 
- The `secret` is the pre-image hashed using Pedersen to compute the `secretHash`. 
- If the `content` or `secret` does not match the entry at `msg_key` the message will not be consumed, and the transaction will revert.

:::info
Note that while the `secret` and the `content` are both hashed, they are actually hashed with different hash functions!
:::

#include_code context_consume_l1_to_l2_message /yarn-project/aztec-nr/aztec/src/context.nr rust

Computing the `content` must be done manually in its current form, as we are still adding a number of bytes utilities. A good example exists within the [Token bridge example](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/token_bridge_contract/src/util.nr).

#include_code claim_public /yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/token_bridge_contract/src/main.nr rust

:::info
The `content_hash` is a sha256 truncated to a field element (~ 254 bits). In Aztec-nr, you can use our `sha256_to_field()` to do a sha256 hash which fits in one field element:

#include_code mint_public_content_hash_nr /yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/token_bridge_contract/src/util.nr rust

In solidity, you can use our `Hash.sha256ToField()` method:

#include_code content_hash_sol_import l1-contracts/test/portals/TokenPortal.sol solidity

#include_code deposit_public l1-contracts/test/portals/TokenPortal.sol solidity

The `secret_hash` uses the pederson hash which fits in a field element. You can use the utility method `computeMessageSecretHash()`in `@aztec/aztec.js` npm package to generate a secret and its corresponding hash.
:::

After the transaction has been mined, the message is consumed, a nullifier is emitted and the tokens have been minted on Aztec and are ready for claiming.

Since the message consumption is emitting a nullifier the same message cannot be consumed again. The index in the message tree is used as part of the nullifier computation, ensuring that the same content and secret being inserted will be distinct messages that can each be consumed. Without the index in the nullifier, it would be possible to perform a kind of attack known as `Faerie Gold` attacks where two seemingly good messages are inserted, but only one of them can be consumed later.

## Passing data to L1

To pass data to L1, we use the `Outbox`. The `Outbox` is the mailbox for L2 to L1 messages. This is the location on L1 where all the messages from L2 will live, and where they can be consumed from.

Similarly to messages going to L2 from L1, a message can only be consumed by the recipient, however note that it is up to the portal contract to ensure that the sender is as expected! 

Recall that we mentioned the Aztec contract specifies what portal it is attached to at deployment. This value is stored in the rollup's contract tree, hence these links are not directly readable on L1. Also, it is possible to attach multiple aztec contracts to the same portal.

The portal must ensure that the sender is as expected. One way to do this, is to compute the addresses before deployment and store them as constants in the contract, however a more flexible solution is to have an `initialize` function in the portal contract which can be used to set the address of the Aztec contract. In this model, the portal contract can check that the sender matches the value it has in storage.

To send a message to L1 from your Aztec contract, you must use the `message_portal` function on the `context`. When messaging to L1, only the `content` is required (as a `Field`). 

#include_code context_message_portal /yarn-project/aztec-nr/aztec/src/context.nr rust

When sending a message from L2 to L1 we don't need to pass recipient, deadline, secret nor fees. Recipient is populated with the attached portal and the remaining values are not needed as the message is inserted into the outbox at the same time as it was included in a block (for the inbox it could be inserted and then only included in rollup block later). 

:::danger
Access control on the L1 portal contract is essential to prevent consumption of messages sent from the wrong L2 contract.
:::

As earlier, we can use a token bridge as an example. In this case, we are burning tokens on L2 and sending a message to the portal to free them on L1.

#include_code exit_to_l1_private yarn-project/noir-contracts/src/contracts/token_bridge_contract/src/main.nr rust

When the transaction is included in a rollup block the message will be inserted into the `Outbox`, where the recipient portal can consume it from. When consuming, the `msg.sender` must match the `recipient` meaning that only portal can actually consume the message.

#include_code l2_to_l1_msg l1-contracts/src/core/libraries/DataStructures.sol solidity

#include_code outbox_consume l1-contracts/src/core/interfaces/messagebridge/IOutbox.sol solidity

As noted earlier, the portal contract should check that the sender is as expected. In the example below, we support only one sender contract (stored in `l2TokenAddress`) so we can just pass it as the sender, that way we will only be able to consume messages from that contract. If multiple senders are supported, you could use a have `mapping(address => bool) allowed` and check that `allowed[msg.sender]` is `true`.

#include_code token_portal_withdraw l1-contracts/test/portals/TokenPortal.sol solidity


## How to deploy a contract with a portal
- Deploy to L1 using Viem, Foundry or your preferred tool;
- Deploy to L2 passing in the address of the L1 portal as its portal contract;
  ```typescript
  const deploymentTx = Contract.deploy(wallet).send({portalContract: tokenPortalAddress});
  ```
- Initialize l1 with l2 address for access control.


## Considerations

### Structure of messages
The application developer should consider creating messages that follow a function call structure e.g., using a function signature and arguments. This will make it easier to prevent producing messages that could be misinterpreted by the recipient. 

An example of a bad format would be using `amount, token_address, recipient_address` as the message for a withdraw function and `amount, token_address, on_behalf_of_address` for a deposit function. Any deposit could then also be mapped to a withdraw or vice versa. 

```solidity 
// Don't to this!
bytes memory message = abi.encode(
  _amount, 
  _token, 
  _to
);

// Do this!
bytes memory message abi.encodeWithSignature(
  "withdraw(uint256,address,address)", 
  _amount, 
  _token, 
  _to
);
```

### Error Handling

Handling error when moving cross chain can quickly get tricky. Since the L1 and L2 calls are practically async and independent of each other, the L1 part of a deposit might execute just fine, with the L2 part failing. If this is not handled well, the funds may be lost forever! The contract builder should therefore consider ways their application can fail cross chain, and handle all cases explicitly.

First, entries in the outboxes **SHOULD** only be consumed if the execution is successful. For an L2 -> L1 call, the L1 execution can revert the transaction completely if anything fails. As the tx is atomic, the failure also reverts consumption.

If it is possible to enter a state where the second part of the execution fails forever, the application builder should consider including additional failure mechanisms (for token withdraws this could be depositing them again etc).

Generally it is good practice to keep cross-chain calls simple to avoid too many edge cases and state reversions.

:::info
Error handling for cross chain messages is handled by the application contract and not the protocol. The protocol only delivers the messages, it does not ensure that they are executed successfully.
:::

### Cancellations

A special type of error is an underpriced transaction - it means that a message is inserted on L1, but the attached fee is too low to be included in a rollup block.

For the case of token bridges, this could lead to funds being locked in the bridge forever, as funds are locked but the message never arrives on L2 to mint the tokens. To address this, the `Inbox` supports cancelling messages after a deadline. However, this must be called by the portal itself, as it will need to "undo" the state changes is made (for example by sending the tokens back to the user).

As this requires logic on the portal itself, it is not something that the protocol can enforce. It must be supported by the application builder when building the portal.

The portal can call the `cancelL2Message` at the `Inbox` when `block.timestamp > deadline` for the message.

#include_code pending_l2_cancel  l1-contracts/src/core/interfaces/messagebridge/IInbox.sol solidity

Building on our token example from earlier, this can be called like:

#include_code token_portal_cancel l1-contracts/test/portals/TokenPortal.sol solidity

The example above ensure that the user can cancel their message if it is underpriced.

### Designated caller
Designating a caller grants the ability to specify who should be able to call a function that consumes a message. This is useful for ordering of batched messages.

When performing multiple cross-chain calls in one action it is important to consider the order of the calls. Say for example, that you want to perform a uniswap trade on L1 because you are a whale and slippage on L2 is too damn high. 

You would practically, withdraw funds from the rollup, swap them on L1, and then deposit the swapped funds back into the rollup. This is a fairly simple process, but it requires that the calls are done in the correct order. For one, if the swap is called before the funds are withdrawn, the swap will fail. And if the deposit is called before the swap, the funds might get lost! 

As message boxes only will allow the recipient portal to consume the message, we can use this to our advantage to ensure that the calls are done in the correct order. Say that we include a designated "caller" in the messages, and that the portal contract checks that the caller matches the designated caller or designated is address(0) (anyone can call). When the message are to be consumed on L1, it can compute the message as seen below:

```solidity
bytes memory message = abi.encodeWithSignature(
  "withdraw(uint256,address,address)", 
  _amount, 
  _to, 
  _withCaller ? msg.sender : address(0)
);
```

This way, the message can be consumed by the portal contract, but only if the caller is the designated caller. By being a bit clever when specifying the designated caller, we can ensure that the calls are done in the correct order. For the Uniswap example, say that we have token portals implemented as we have done throughout this page, and a Uniswap portal implementing the designated caller.

We require that the Uniswap portal is the caller of the withdraw, and that the uniswap portal implementation is executing the withdraw before the swap.  
The order of execution can be constrained in the contract. Since all of the messages are emitted to L1 in the same transaction, we can leverage transaction atomicity to ensure success of failure of all messages. 

Note, that crossing the L1/L2 chasm is asynchronous, so there could be a situation where the user has burned their assets on L2 but the swap fails on L1! This could be due to major price movements or the like. In such a case, the user could be stuck with funds on L1 that they cannot get back to L2 unless the portal contract implements a way to properly handle such errors.

:::caution
Designated callers are enforced at the contract level for contracts that are not the rollup itself, and should not be trusted to implement the contract correctly. The user should always be aware that it is possible for the developer to implement something that looks like designated caller without providing the abilities to the user.
