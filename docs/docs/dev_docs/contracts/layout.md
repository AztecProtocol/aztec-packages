title: Structure
---

A contract is a collection of persistent [state variables](./syntax/storage.md), and [functions](./syntax/functions) which may manipulate these variables. Functions and state variables within a contract's scope are said to belong to that contract. A contract can only access and modify its own state. If a contract wishes to access or modify another contract's state, it must make a call to an external function of the other contract. For anything to happen on the Aztec network, an external function of a contract needs to be called.

# Contract

A contract may be declared and given a name using the `contract` keyword (see snippet below). By convention, contracts are named in `PascalCase`.

```rust title="contract keyword"
// highlight-next-line
contract MyContract {

    // Imports 

    // Storage 

    // Functions
}
```
:::info A note for vanilla Noir devs
There is no [`main()`](https://noir-lang.org/getting_started/breakdown/#mainnr) function within a Noir `contract` scope. More than one function can be an entrypoint.

## Directory structure

Here's a common layout for a basic Aztec.nr Contract project:

```title="layout of an aztec contract project"
─── my_aztec_contract_project
       ├── src
       │     ├── main.nr       <-- your contract
       └── Nargo.toml          <-- package and dependency management
```

- See the vanilla Noir docs for [more info on packages](https://noir-lang.org/modules_packages_crates/crates_and_packages).
- You can review the structure of a complete contract in the token contract tutorial [here](../tutorials/writing_token_contract.md).
