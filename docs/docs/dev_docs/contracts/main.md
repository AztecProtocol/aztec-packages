# Contracts

## What is a Noir Contract?

**Noir** is a domain specific language for creating and verifying proofs. It's design choices are influenced heavily by Rust.

We've extended the Noir language to understand the notion of an **'Aztec smart contract'**.

- A **smart contract** is just a collection of persistent state variables, and a collection of functions which may edit those state variables.
- An **Aztec smart contract** is a smart contract with **private** state variables and **private** functions.
- A **Noir Contract** is just an Aztec smart contract, written in Noir syntax.


> Throughout these docs, we'll refer to "regular Noir" as being the version of Noir without the Noir Contract syntax.



# Getting started

Please consider using the [TUTORIAL-TEMPLATE](../../TUTORIAL_TEMPLATE.md) for standalone guides / tutorials.

## Installing Noir

To write a Noir Contract, you need to write Noir, and to write Noir, you need to [install Nargo](https://noir-lang.org/getting_started/nargo_installation).

## Installing Noir tooling

There are a number of tools to make writing Noir Contracts more pleasant. See [here](https://github.com/noir-lang/awesome-noir#get-coding).

## Quick start

Download an Aztec Box. (Josh / Ze to build :) ).

Or, if you don't want to do that, here's more detail on doing it all yourself:
