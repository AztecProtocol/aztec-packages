title: Executing Private Swap on L1
---

This works very similarly to the public flow.

In the public flow, you can call `claim_public()` on the output token bridge which consumes the deposit message and mints your assets.

In the private flow, you can choose to leak your secret for L1 â†’ L2 message consumption to let someone mint the notes on L2 and then you can later redeem these notes to yourself by presenting the preimage to `secret_hash_for_redeeming_minted_notes` and calling the `redeem_shield()` method on the token contract.

In your `UniswapPortal.sol`, paste this:

#include_code solidity_uniswap_swap_private l1-contracts/test/portals/UniswapPortal.sol solidity
