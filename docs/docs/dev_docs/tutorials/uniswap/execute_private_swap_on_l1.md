title: Executing Private Swap on L1
---

To execute the swaps on L1, go back to the `UniswapPortal.sol` we [created earlier](./l1_portal.md) in `l1-contracts`.

#include_code solidity_uniswap_swap_private l1-contracts/test/portals/UniswapPortal.sol solidity

This works very similarly to the public flow.
