title: Uniswap Portal on L1
---

In this step we will set up our Solidity portal contract.

In `l1-tokens` create a new file called `UniswapPortal.sol`

```sh
cd l1-contracts/contracts && touch UniswapPortal.sol
```

and paste this inside:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import {IERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

import {IRegistry} from "@aztec/l1-contracts/src/core/interfaces/messagebridge/IRegistry.sol";
import {DataStructures} from "@aztec/l1-contracts/src/core/libraries/DataStructures.sol";
import {Hash} from "@aztec/l1-contracts/src/core/libraries/Hash.sol";

#include_code setup l1-contracts/test/portals/UniswapPortal.sol raw
```

In this set up we defined the `initialize()` function and a struct (`LocalSwapVars`) to manage assets being swapped.

Like we saw in the [TokenPortal](../token_portal/depositing_to_aztec.md), we initialize this portal with the registry contract address (to fetch the appropriate inbox and outbox) and the portalâ€™s sister contract address on L2.

In the next step we will set up the appropriate L2 Uniswap contract!
