title: How to write a custom oracle
---

Before continuing, please note that it is **not** advised to write a custom oracle for your dapp. Oracles are implemented in the PXE, so all users of your dapp would have to use a PXE service with your custom oracle included. 

If you want to inject some arbitrary data that does not have a dedicated oracle, you can use [popCapsule](../contracts/syntax/oracles.md#how-to-use-the-pop_capsule-oracle).

However, in the case for exploring or contributing to Aztec Protocol, please read this how-to guide.
