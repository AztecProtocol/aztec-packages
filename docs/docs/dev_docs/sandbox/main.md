# The Aztec Sandbox

Please use the [TUTORIAL-TEMPLATE](../../TUTORIAL_TEMPLATE.md) for standalone guides / tutorials.


# GETTING STARTED:

Very quick, and to the point one-pager: https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/issues/1406

# Questions to answer:

- What is the sandbox?
  - High level, pithy outline.
- What can you do with the sandbox?
  - Deploy contracts
  - Simulate function execution
  - Execute private and public contracts

- How do you download and install the sandbox?
  - How do you do it:
    - From up.aztec.network?
    - From docker?
    - From source?

- How do you interact with the sandbox?
  - @aztec/cli
    - What is the cli?
    - When would someone prefer using the cli over aztec.js?
    - We should also have a detailed aztec-cli section (see below)
  - aztec.js
    - What is aztec.js?
    - When would someone prefer using aztec.js over the cli?
    - We should also have a detailed aztec.js section (see [here](../dapps/main.md))
  - RPC calls directly?
    - How would an advanced user make rpc calls directly to the sandbox? Can they, even?

- aztec/cli
  - Refer directly to the npm package's explanations?


FOR INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING A WALLET, WE SHOULD WRITE DOCS [HERE](../wallets/building_a_wallet.md)

ERRORS:
- Add any error explanations to [errors.md](./common_errors.md) (and break that file into multiple files if it's too unwieldy).


- RPC calls directly
  - Lower priority, but eventually we should answer all of the aztec.js questions here as well.
