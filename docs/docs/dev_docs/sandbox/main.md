## What is the Aztec Sandbox?

The Aztec Sandbox is local development system against which you can build and test Aztec.nr contracts in a fast, safe, and free environment.

For a complete walk-through deploying and using a private contract with the Sandbox and CLI, see our [quickstart](../getting_started/quickstart).
