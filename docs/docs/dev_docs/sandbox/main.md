# Aztec Sandbox

## What is the Aztec Sandbox?

The Aztec Sandbox is local development system against which you can build and test Noir contracts in a fast, safe, and free environment.

To learn more and to download to for yourself you can visit the [website](https://sandbox.aztec.network).

## Requirements

The Sandbox runs on Docker, so any x86 Docker environment should be able to host it.

The following command will download and execute a script that uses docker compose to launch an instance of Anvil and the Sandbox side by side. This will get you up and running in just a few seconds.

`/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL 'https://sandbox.aztec.network')"`

For a complete walk-through deploying and using a private contract, see our [getting started guide](../getting_started/sandbox.md).
