title: How to Participate?
---

Decentralization is one of our core values, so we want to encourage participation as much as possible and in any way you can.

## Improve the protocol

- Join us at our [Discourse forum](https://discourse.aztec.network/) or [Discord server](https://discord.gg/DgWG2DBMyB) to discuss all things related to Aztec and share your feedback

## Contribute code

- Check out the monorepo on GitHub [here](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages)
- We have some [good first issues](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/labels/good%20first%20issue) for newcomers
- Anyone can open an issue, so please feel free to create one
- If you've built something for the ecosystem that others should see, add it to the [Awesome-Aztec Repo](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/awesome-aztec)

## Grants

- We often run grants programs to support awesome projects and teams
- We are currently operating with a retroactive grants funding model, and we strive to respond back to grants applications with a decision within a few days. Check out our [grants page](https://aztec.network/grants/) for more information
- Keep checking back to see when we're opening up a new wave of grants
