# Aztec Documentation

## Aztec is a Privacy-First L2 on Ethereum

On Ethereum today, everything is publicly visible, by everyone. In the real world, people enjoy privacy. Aztec brings privacy to Ethereum.

<blockquote style={{textAlign: "right"}}>
‚ÄúWhen we started Aztec, the technology to scale blockchains privately didn‚Äôt exist. Since then, we‚Äôve assembled a team of world-class cryptographers who continuously redefine the state-of-the-art. Inventing PLONK ‚Äî the paradigm-defining universal zk-SNARK ‚Äî showcases our ability to produce technology that matches our ambitions: unlocking an entire universe of blockchain applications that couldn‚Äôt exist without privacy.‚Äù

_Zac Williamson, CEO and Co-founder, Aztec_

## Values

Our vision is to create a fairer, more open financial eco-system, built with encryption at its core.

We believe decentralization is premised on individual rights ‚Äî without widely accessible encryption, we compromise our ability to choose how we live our lives and earn our livelihoods.

Aztec is:

- **Private.**: The only true zero-knowledge rollup, built with a privacy-first UTXO architecture to allow developers to build privacy preserving programable applications.
- **Accessible.**: Proving transaction validity via recursive aggregation of zero-knowledge proofs, significantly reduces transaction costs, keeping the protocol accessible to the masses.
- **Compliant**: The programmable nature of Aztec smart contracts, enables dApp developers to code privacy-preserving audit and compliance checks into apps, while fully preserving a credible neutral protocol layer.
