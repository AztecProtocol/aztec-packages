# Aztec Documentation

## What is Aztec?

### Aztec is a Privacy-First L2 on Ethereum

On Ethereum today, everything is publicly visible, by everyone. In the real world, people enjoy privacy. Aztec brings privacy to Ethereum.

- private functions, executed and proved on a user's device
- public functions, executed in the Aztec Virtual Machine
- private state, stored as UTXOs that only the owner can decrypt
- public state, stored in a public merkle tree
- composability between private/public execution and private/public state
- public and private messaging with Ethereum

To learn more about how Aztec achieves these things, check out the [Aztec concepts overview](/aztec/index).
