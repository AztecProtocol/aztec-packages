Aztec Connect is no longer being actively developed.

:::

The rollup instance operated by Aztec will stop accepting deposits on March 21st, 2023. Read the full announcement [here](https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/sunsetting-aztec-connect-a786edce5cae).

We will continue to process transactions and withdrawals for funds that are already in the rollup until March 2024, at which point we will stop running the sequencer. See the [zk.money](#zkmoney) section below for details on how to withdraw funds.

## Run your own AC

All of the infrastructure and associated code required to run and interact with the Aztec Connect rollup is open source, so anyone can publish blocks after we stop, or run their own instance of the rollup software.

You can find the old documentation site that includes all of the pertinent information on the [`aztec-connect` branch](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/docs/tree/aztec-connect) of the docs repository.

The code has been open sourced and you can find the relevant repositories linked below.

### Exiting LUSD Borrowing

Your total TB-275 tokens represents the entirety of your share of the collateral. Spending all your TB-275 will release your entire share of the collateral (minus the market value of the debt to be repaid).
