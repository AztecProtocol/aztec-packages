## Run your own AC

Aztec Labs ran a sequencer for a year in maintenance mode, providing free withdrawals until the 31st March 2024.

However, all of the infrastructure and associated code required to run and interact with the Aztec Connect rollup is open source, so anyone can publish blocks, or run their own instance of the rollup software. For convenience, we've provided an [Aztec Connect Ejector](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect-ejector) you can refer to for instructions.
You can find the old documentation site that includes all of the pertinent information on the [`aztec-connect` branch](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/docs/tree/aztec-connect) of the docs repository.

### Source Code
