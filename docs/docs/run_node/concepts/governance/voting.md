title: Voting on Proposals
---

Holders have the ability to vote on proposals as long as they lock any Hypothetical Assets within the Governance contract. The act of locking the funds can be thought of as “activatingˮ the voting power of Hypothetical Asset. Locked Hypothetical Assets used to vote on a proposal must wait a delay before being withdrawn to prevent malicious governance attacks.

Hypothetical Assets locked in the Governance contract are simply locked and not “at stakeˮ i.e. there are no slashing conditions.

Since sequencers may be able to stake Hypothetical Assets with the rollup instances in order to join the validator set, the rollup instance could in turn lock those Hypothetical Assets in the Governance contract and vote on behalf of the sequencers. This is expected behavior.
