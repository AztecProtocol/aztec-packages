In this guide, we will create our first Aztec.nr smart contract. We will build a simple private counter. This contract will get you started with the basic setup and syntax of Aztec.nr, but doesn't showcase the awesome stuff Aztec is capable of.

## Prerequisites

- You have followed the [quickstart](../../../guides/developer_guides/getting_started/quickstart.md)
- Running Aztec Sandbox

## Set up a project

Create a new directory called `aztec-private-counter`

```bash
mkdir aztec-private-counter
```

then create a `contracts` folder inside where our Aztec.nr contract will live:

```bash
cd aztec-private-counter
mkdir contracts
```

Inside `contracts` create a new project called `counter`:

```bash
cd contracts
aztec-nargo new --contract counter
```

Your structure should look like this:

```tree
.
|-aztec-private-counter
| |-contracts
| | |--counter
| | |  |--src
| | |  |  |--main.nr
| | |  |--Nargo.toml
```

The file `main.nr` will soon turn into our smart contract!

Add the following dependencies to `Nargo.toml` under the autogenerated content:

```toml
[dependencies]
aztec = { git="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/", tag="#include_aztec_version", directory="noir-projects/aztec-nr/aztec" }
value_note = { git="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/", tag="#include_aztec_version", directory="noir-projects/aztec-nr/value-note"}
easy_private_state = { git="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/", tag="#include_aztec_version", directory="noir-projects/aztec-nr/easy-private-state"}
```

## Define the functions

Go to `main.nr` and start with this contract initialization:

```rust
contract Counter {
}
```

This defines a contract called `Counter`.

## Imports

We need to define some imports.

Write this within your contract at the top:

#include_code imports /noir-projects/noir-contracts/contracts/counter_contract/src/main.nr rust

`AztecAddress, Map`

`AztecAddress` is a type for storing contract (including account) addresses. `Map` is a private state variable that functions like a dictionary, relating Fields to other state variables.

`value_note`

Notes are fundamental to how Aztec manages privacy. A note is a privacy-preserving representation of an amount of tokens associated with a nullifier key (that can be owned by an owner), while encrypting the amount. In this contract, we are using the `value_note` library. This is a type of note interface for storing a single Field, eg a balance - or, in our case, a counter.

We are also using `balance_utils` from this import, a useful library that allows us to utilize value notes as if they are simple balances.

`EasyPrivateUint`

This allows us to store our counter in a way that acts as an integer, abstracting the note logic.

## Declare storage

Add this below the imports. It declares the storage variables for our contract. We are going to store a mapping of values for each `AztecAddress`.

#include_code storage_struct /noir-projects/noir-contracts/contracts/counter_contract/src/main.nr rust

## Keep the counter private

Now we’ve got a mechanism for storing our private state, we can start using it to ensure the privacy of balances.

Let’s create a constructor method to run on deployment that assigns an initial supply of tokens to a specified owner. This function is called `initialize`, but behaves like a constructor. It is the `#[aztec(initializer)]` decorator that specifies that this function behaves like a constructor. Write this:

#include_code constructor /noir-projects/noir-contracts/contracts/counter_contract/src/main.nr rust

This function accesses the counts from storage. Then it assigns the passed initial counter to the `owner`'s counter privately using `at().add()`.

We have annotated this and other functions with `#[aztec(private)]` which are ABI macros so the compiler understands it will handle private inputs.

## Incrementing our counter

Now let’s implement the `increment` function we defined in the first step.

#include_code increment /noir-projects/noir-contracts/contracts/counter_contract/src/main.nr rust

The `increment` function works very similarly to the `constructor`, but instead directly adds 1 to the counter rather than passing in an initial count parameter.

## Prevent double spending

Because our counters are private, the network can't directly verify if a note was spent or not, which could lead to double-spending. To solve this, we use a nullifier - a unique identifier generated from each spent note and its nullifier key. Although this isn't really an issue in this simple smart contract, Aztec injects a special function called `compute_note_hash_and_optionally_a_nullifier` to determine these values for any given note produced by this contract.

## Getting a counter

The last thing we need to implement is the function in order to retrieve a counter. In the `getCounter` we defined in the first step, write this:

#include_code get_counter /noir-projects/noir-contracts/contracts/counter_contract/src/main.nr rust

This function is `unconstrained` which allows us to fetch data from storage without a transaction. We retrieve a reference to the `owner`'s `counter` from the `counters` Map. The `get_balance` function then operates on the owner's counter. This yields a private counter that only the private key owner can decrypt.

## Compile

Now we've written a simple Aztec.nr smart contract, we can compile it with `aztec-nargo`.

### Compile the smart contract

In `./contracts/counter/` directory, run this:

```bash
aztec-nargo compile
```

This will compile the smart contract and create a `target` folder with a `.json` artifact inside. Do not worry if you see some warnings - Aztec is in fast development and it is likely you will see some irrelevant warning messages.

After compiling, you can generate a typescript class using `aztec codegen` command.

In the same directory, run this:

```bash
aztec codegen -o src/artifacts target
```

You can now use the artifact and/or the TS class in your Aztec.js!
