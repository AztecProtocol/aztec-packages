title: Redeeming Swapped Assets on L2
---
So you emitted a message to withdraw input tokens to L1 and a message to swap. Then you or someone on your behalf can swap on L1 and emit a message to deposit swapped assets to L2,

You still need to "claim" these swapped funds on L2.

In the public flow, you can call [`claim_public()`](../token_portal/minting_on_aztec.md) on the output token bridge which consumes the deposit message and mints your assets.

In the private flow, you can choose to leak your secret for L1 â†’ L2 message consumption to let someone mint the notes on L2 (by calling [`claim_private()`](../token_portal/minting_on_aztec.md) on the output token bridge) and then you can later redeem these notes to yourself by presenting the preimage to `secret_hash_for_redeeming_minted_notes` and calling the `redeem_shield()` method on the token contract.

In the next step we will write the typescript code that interacts with all these contracts on the sandbox to actually execute the swaps!
