In this guide, we will create our first Aztec.nr smart contract. We will build a simple private counter, where you can keep your own private counter - so no one knows what ID you are at or when you increment! This contract will get you started with the basic setup and syntax of Aztec.nr, but doesn't showcase all of the awesome stuff Aztec is capable of.

## Prerequisites

- You have followed the [quickstart](../../../getting_started.md)
- Running Aztec Sandbox
- Installed [Noir LSP](../../../guides/local_env/installing_noir_lsp.md) (optional)

## Set up a project

Create a new directory called `aztec-private-counter`

```bash
mkdir aztec-private-counter
```

then create a `contracts` folder inside where our Aztec.nr contract will live:

```bash
cd aztec-private-counter
mkdir contracts
```

Inside `contracts` create a new project called `counter`:

```bash
cd contracts
aztec-nargo new --contract counter
```

Your structure should look like this:

```tree
.
|-aztec-private-counter
| |-contracts
| | |--counter
| | |  |--src
| | |  |  |--main.nr
| | |  |--Nargo.toml
```

The file `main.nr` will soon turn into our smart contract!

Add the following dependencies to `Nargo.toml` under the autogenerated content:

```toml
[dependencies]
aztec = { git="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/", tag="#include_aztec_version", directory="noir-projects/aztec-nr/aztec" }
value_note = { git="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/", tag="#include_aztec_version", directory="noir-projects/aztec-nr/value-note"}
easy_private_state = { git="https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/", tag="#include_aztec_version", directory="noir-projects/aztec-nr/easy-private-state"}
```

## Define the functions

Go to `main.nr` and start with this contract initialization:

```rust
#include_code setup /noir-projects/noir-contracts/contracts/test/counter_contract/src/main.nr raw
}
```

This defines a contract called `Counter`.

## Imports

We need to define some imports.

Write this within your contract at the top:

#include_code imports /noir-projects/noir-contracts/contracts/test/counter_contract/src/main.nr rust

`AztecAddress, Map`

`AztecAddress` is a type for storing contract (including account) addresses. `Map` is a private state variable that functions like a dictionary, relating Fields to other state variables.

`value_note`

Notes are fundamental to how Aztec manages privacy. A note is a privacy-preserving representation of some arbitrary information. A commitment to a note is stored on-chain, it is associated with a nullifier key (that can be owned by an owner) so it can be spent, and encrypted note information is often emitted on-chain for later retrieval. In this contract, we are using the `value_note` library. This is a type of note interface for storing a single Field, e.g. a balance - or, in our case, a counter.

We are also using `balance_utils` from this import, a useful library that allows us to utilize value notes as if they are simple balances.

`EasyPrivateUint`

This allows us to store our counter in a way that acts as an integer, abstracting the note logic.

## Declare storage

Add this below the imports. It declares the storage variables for our contract. We are going to store a mapping of values for each `AztecAddress`.

#include_code storage_struct /noir-projects/noir-contracts/contracts/test/counter_contract/src/main.nr rust

## Keep the counter private

Now we’ve got a mechanism for storing our private state, we can start using it to ensure the privacy of balances.

Let’s create a constructor method to run on deployment that assigns an initial count to a specified owner. This function is called `initialize`, but behaves like a constructor. It is the `#[initializer]` decorator that specifies that this function behaves like a constructor. Write this:

#include_code constructor /noir-projects/noir-contracts/contracts/test/counter_contract/src/main.nr rust

This function accesses the counts from storage. Then it assigns the passed initial counter to the `owner`'s counter privately using `at().add()`.

We have annotated this and other functions with `#[private]` which are ABI macros so the compiler understands it will handle private inputs.

## Incrementing our counter

Now let’s implement the `increment` function we defined in the first step.

#include_code increment /noir-projects/noir-contracts/contracts/test/counter_contract/src/main.nr rust

The `increment` function works very similarly to the `constructor`, but instead directly adds 1 to the counter rather than passing in an initial count parameter.

## Prevent double spending

Because our counters are private, the network can't directly verify if a note was spent or not, which could lead to double-spending. To solve this, we use a nullifier - a unique identifier generated from each spent note and its nullifier key.

## Getting a counter

The last thing we need to implement is the function in order to retrieve a counter. In the `getCounter` we defined in the first step, write this:

#include_code get_counter /noir-projects/noir-contracts/contracts/test/counter_contract/src/main.nr rust

This function is `unconstrained` which allows us to fetch data from storage without a transaction. We retrieve a reference to the `owner`'s `counter` from the `counters` Map. The `get_balance` function then operates on the owner's counter. This yields a private counter that only the private key owner can decrypt.

## Compile

Now we've written a simple Aztec.nr smart contract, we can compile it with `aztec-nargo`.

### Compile the smart contract

In `./contracts/counter/` directory, run this:

```bash
aztec-nargo compile
```

This will compile the smart contract and create a `target` folder with a `.json` artifact inside. Do not worry if you see some warnings - Aztec is in fast development and it is likely you will see some irrelevant warning messages.

After compiling, you can generate a typescript class using `aztec codegen` command.

In the same directory, run this:

```bash
aztec codegen -o src/artifacts target
```

You can now use the artifact and/or the TS class in your Aztec.js!

## Investigate the `increment` function

Private functions in Aztec contracts are executed client-side, to maintain privacy. Developers need to be mindful of how computationally expensive it is to generate client side proofs for the private functions in the contract they write. To help understand the cost, we can use the Aztec flamegraph tool. The tool takes a contract artifact and function and generates an SVG file that shows the constraint count of each step in the function.

Run it for the `increment` function:

```bash
SERVE=1 aztec flamegraph target/counter-Counter.json increment
```

`SERVE=1` will start a local server to view the flamegraph in the browser. You can also run it without this flag and open the generated SVG file in your browser manually.

Note the total gate count at the bottom of the image. The image is interactive; you can hover over different parts of the graph to see the full function name of the execution step and its gate count. This tool also provides insight into the low-level operations that are performed in the private function. Don't worry about the details of the internals of the function right now, just be aware that the more complex the function, the more gates it will use and try out the flamegraph tool on your own functions.
