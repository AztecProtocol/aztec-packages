The `contract` module provides utilities for deploying and interacting with contracts, based on a
`Wallet` instance and a compiled artifact. Refer to the [account](account.md) module for how to obtain a valid
`Wallet` instance, and to the [Compiling contracts](https://docs.aztec.network/developers/contracts/compiling)
section of the documentation for how to generate an artifact out of your Noir source code.

The [Contract](../classes/contract.Contract.md) class is the main class in this module, and provides static methods for deploying
a contract or interacting with an already deployed one. The `methods` property of the contract instance
provides access to private, public, and view methods, that can be invoked in a transaction via `send()`,
or can be queried via `view()`.

```ts
const contract = await Contract.deploy(wallet, MyContractArtifact, [...constructorArgs]).send().deployed();
console.log(`Contract deployed at ${contract.address}`);
```

```ts
const contract = await Contract.at(address, MyContractArtifact, wallet);
await contract.methods.mint(1000, owner).send().wait();
console.log(`Total supply is now ${await contract.methods.totalSupply().view()}`);
```

The result of calling a method in a contract instance, such as `contract.methods.mint(1000, owner)`
in the example, is a [ContractFunctionInteraction](../classes/contract.ContractFunctionInteraction.md) instance. Usually this will be just sent as
a transaction to the network via the `send` method, but you can also `simulate` it without sending,
or obtaining the `request` for aggregating into a [BatchCall](../classes/contract.BatchCall.md).

The result of `send`ing a transaction is a [SentTx](../classes/contract.SentTx.md) object, from which you can get the
transaction hash, or simply `wait` until the transaction is mined and the local PXE Service
has synchronized its changes.

**`Remarks`**

If you are using typescript, consider using the
[autogenerated type-safe interfaces](https://docs.aztec.network/developers/contracts/compiling#typescript-interfaces)
for interacting with your contracts.

## Type Aliases

### ContractMethod

Ƭ **ContractMethod**: (...`args`: `any`[]) => [`ContractFunctionInteraction`](../classes/contract.ContractFunctionInteraction.md) & \{ `selector`: `FunctionSelector`  }

Type representing a contract method that returns a ContractFunctionInteraction instance
and has a readonly 'selector' property of type Buffer. Takes any number of arguments.

___

### DeployOptions

Ƭ **DeployOptions**: \{ `contractAddressSalt?`: `Fr` ; `portalContract?`: `EthAddress`  } & [`SendMethodOptions`](contract.md#sendmethodoptions)

Options for deploying a contract on the Aztec network.
Allows specifying a portal contract, contract address salt, and additional send method options.

___

### DeployTxReceipt

Ƭ **DeployTxReceipt**\<`TContract`\>: `FieldsOf`\<`TxReceipt`\> & \{ `contract`: `TContract`  }

Extends a transaction receipt with a contract instance that represents the newly deployed contract.

#### Type parameters

| Name | Type |
| :------ | :------ |
| `TContract` | extends [`ContractBase`](../classes/contract.ContractBase.md) = [`Contract`](../classes/contract.Contract.md) |

___

### DeployedWaitOpts

Ƭ **DeployedWaitOpts**: [`WaitOpts`](contract.md#waitopts) & \{ `wallet?`: [`Wallet`](account.md#wallet)  }

Options related to waiting for a deployment tx.

___

### SendMethodOptions

Ƭ **SendMethodOptions**: `Object`

Represents options for calling a (constrained) function in a contract.
Allows the user to specify the sender address and nonce for a transaction.

#### Type declaration

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `skipPublicSimulation?` | `boolean` | Wether to skip the simulation of the public part of the transaction. |

___

### ViewMethodOptions

Ƭ **ViewMethodOptions**: `Object`

Represents the options for a view method in a contract function interaction.
Allows specifying the address from which the view method should be called.

#### Type declaration

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `from?` | `AztecAddress` | The sender's Aztec address. |

___

### WaitOpts

Ƭ **WaitOpts**: `Object`

Options related to waiting for a tx.

#### Type declaration

| Name | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `debug?` | `boolean` | Whether to include information useful for debugging/testing in the receipt. |
| `interval?` | `number` | The time interval (in seconds) between retries to fetch the transaction receipt. Defaults to 1. |
| `timeout?` | `number` | The maximum time (in seconds) to wait for the transaction to be mined. Defaults to 60. |
| `waitForNotesSync?` | `boolean` | Whether to wait for the PXE Service to sync all notes up to the block in which this tx was mined. If false, then any queries that depend on state set by this transaction may return stale data. Defaults to true. |

## Variables

### DefaultWaitOpts

• `Const` **DefaultWaitOpts**: [`WaitOpts`](contract.md#waitopts)
