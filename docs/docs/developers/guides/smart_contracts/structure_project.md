This guide explains how to set up and structure your project for Aztec smart contracts.

## Before you start

You should have installed the sandbox, which includes local development tools, as described in [the getting started guide](../../getting_started.md).

## Setup

To create a new project, run the following command:

```bash
aztec-nargo new new_project --contract
```

This will create a new project with a `Nargo.toml` file and a `src` directory with a `main.nr` file where your contract will be written.

## Dependencies

Define Aztec.nr as a dependency in your `Nargo.toml` file. Aztec.nr is a package that contains the core functionality for writing Aztec smart contracts.

```toml
[dependencies]
aztec = { git = "https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages", tag = "#include_aztec_version", directory = "noir-projects/aztec-nr/aztec" }
```

## Writing a contract

To write a contract:

1. Import aztec.nr into your contract in the `src/main.nr` file and declare your contract

```rust
#include_code setup /noir-projects/noir-contracts/contracts/test/counter_contract/src/main.nr raw
```

2. Define imports in your contract block

For example, these are the imports for the example counter contract:

#include_code imports /noir-projects/noir-contracts/contracts/test/counter_contract/src/main.nr rust

3. Declare your contract storage below your imports

#include_code storage_struct /noir-projects/noir-contracts/contracts/test/counter_contract/src/main.nr rust

4. Declare a constructor with `#[initializer]`. Constructors can be private or public functions.

#include_code constructor /noir-projects/noir-contracts/contracts/test/counter_contract/src/main.nr rust

5. Declare your contract functions

#include_code increment /noir-projects/noir-contracts/contracts/test/counter_contract/src/main.nr rust

There is a lot more detail and nuance to writing contracts, but this should give you a good starting point.

emitting events, calling functions on other contracts and other common patterns.
