Notes are the fundamental data structure in Aztec when working with private state. Using Aztec.nr, developers can define note types which allow flexibility in how notes are stored and nullified.

In this section there are guides about how to work with `AddressNote`, `ValueNote`, and custom notes in Aztec.nr. You can learn more about notes in the [concepts section](../../../../../aztec/concepts/storage/notes.md).
