description: Comprehensive guide to using notes for private state management in your Aztec smart contracts.
---

Notes are the fundamental data structure in Aztec when working with private state. Using Aztec.nr, developers can define note types which allow flexibility in how notes are stored and nullified.

In this section there are guides about how to work with `AddressNote`, `ValueNote` from Aztec.nr and how to implement your own notes.
You can learn more about notes in the [concepts section](../../../../../aztec/concepts/storage/notes.md).
