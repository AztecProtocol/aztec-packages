title: Using Notes
---

## Preamble
Some optionally background resources on notes can be seen here:
- [High level network architecture](https://docs.aztec.network/learn/about_aztec/technical_overview#high-level-network-architecture), specifically the Private Execution Environment
- [Transaction lifecycle (simple diagram)](https://docs.aztec.network/learn/concepts/transactions#simple-example-of-the-private-transaction-lifecycle)
- [Public and Private state](https://docs.aztec.network/learn/concepts/hybrid_state/main)

Outside of this there are many more details to discover that will be skipped over for now:
- Private and public contexts
- Encryption keys and events
- Oracle's role in using notes
- Value Serialization/Deserialization

This explainer will go through some examples that touch on what has been covered so far.

### Some code context
The way Aztec (`aztec-packages` monorepo) benefits from the Noir language is via three important components:
- `Aztec-nr` - a Noir framework enabling contracts on Aztec, written in Noir. Includes useful Note implementations.
- `noir contracts` - , example Aztec contracts
- `noir-protocol-circuits` - a crate containing essential circuits for the protocol (public circuits and private wrappers)

A lot of what we will look at will be in [aztec-nr/aztec/src/note](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/noir-projects/aztec-nr/aztec/src/note), specifically the lifecycle and note interface.
Looking at the noir circuits in these components, you will see references to the distinction between public/private execution and state.

## Lifecycle functions
Inside the [lifecycle](
https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/noir-projects/aztec-nr/aztec/src/note/lifecycle.nr) circuits we see the functions to create and destroy a note, implemented as insertions of note hashes and nullifiers respectively.

We also see a function to create a note hash from the public context, a way of creating a private variable from a public call (run in the sequencer).

## Note Interface functions
To see a [note_interface](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/noir-projects/aztec-nr/aztec/src/note/note_interface.nr) implementation, we will look at a simple [ValueNote](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/noir-projects/aztec-nr/value-note/src/value_note.nr).

### Computing hashes and nullifiers
A few key functions in the note interface are around computing the note hash and nullifier, with logic to get/use secret keys from the private context.

In the ValueNote implementation you'll notice that it uses the `pedersen_hash` function. This is currently required by the protocol, but may be updated to another hashing function, like poseidon.

As a convenience, the outer [note/utils.nr](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/noir-projects/aztec-nr/aztec/src/note/utils.nr) contains an implementation of a function required by Aztec contracts using private storage: `compute_note_hash_and_nullifier`

### Serialization and deserialization
Serialization/deserialization of content is used to convert between the Note's variables and a generic array of Field elements. The Field type is understood and used by lower level crypographic libraries.
This is analogous to the encoding/decoding between variables and bytes in solidity.

For example in ValueNote, the `serialize_content` function simply returns: the value, owner address (as a field) and the note randomness; as an array of Field elements.

## Value as a sum of Note
We recall that multiple notes are associated with a "slot" (or ID), and so the value of a numerical note (like ValueNote) is the sum of each note's value.
The helper function in [balance_utils](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/noir-projects/aztec-nr/value-note/src/balance_utils.nr) implements this logic taking a `Set` of `ValueNotes`.

A couple of things worth clarifying:
- A `Set` takes a Generic type, specified here as `ValueNote`, but can be any `Note` type (for all notes in the set).
- A `Set` of notes also specifies *the* slot of all Notes that it holds.

## Abstracting Notes
The Aztec.nr framework includes an [easy_private_state](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/noir-projects/aztec-nr/easy-private-state/src/easy_private_state.nr) for use in contracts.

The struct is an `EasyPrivateUint` that contains a Context, Set of ValueNotes, and storage_slot (used when setting the Set).

The `add` function shows the simplicity of appending a new note to all existing ones. On the other hand, `sub` (subtraction), needs to first add up all existing values (consuming them in the process), and then insert a single new value of the difference between the sum and parameter.
