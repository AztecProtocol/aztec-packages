title: Testing Contracts
---

We are currently working on a Foundry-like tool for writing unit tests in Noir. 

For now, it is easier to write e2e tests using [Aztec.js](../../aztecjs/main.md).

To make testing easier, the sandbox is shipped with cheat codes to easily test in different states. Read about them and find a list [here](../../sandbox/references/cheat_codes.md).

## Examples

You can find example tests in the [aztec-starter](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-starter/tree/main) repo as well as the [Aztec Boxes](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/boxes).
