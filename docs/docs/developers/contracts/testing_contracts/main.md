title: Testing Contracts
---

We are currently working on a Foundry-like tool for writing unit tests in Noir. 

For now, it is easier to write e2e tests using [Aztec.js](../../aztecjs/main.md).

To make testing easier, the sandbox is shipped with cheat codes to easily test in different states. Read about them and find a list [here](../../sandbox/references/cheat_codes.md).
