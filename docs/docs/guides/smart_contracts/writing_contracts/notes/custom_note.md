title: Custom notes in Aztec.nr
---

It may be useful to write a custom note if you want to hold a specific type of private data or struct that does not have a default implementation in Aztec.nr. Using a custom note means that the entire note is nullified with one nullifier, which may be better for your circumstances than having multiple notes that need nullified.  If you want to work with values or addresses, you can check out [ValueNote](./value_note.md) or [AddressNote](./address_note.md). 

## Create a new file for your note
