An Aztec transaction typically consists of a private and a public part. The private part is where the user executes contract logic within the PXE and generates a proof of execution, which is then sent to the sequencer.

Since proof generation is an expensive operation that needs to be done on the client side, it is important to optimize the private contract logic. It is desirable to keep the gate count of circuits representing the private contract logic as low as possible.

A private transaction can involve multiple function calls. It starts with an account `entrypoint()` which may call several private functions to execute the application logic, which in turn might call other functions. Moreover, every private function call has to go through a round of kernel circuits. Read more about the transaction lifecycle [here](../../../aztec/concepts/transactions.md).

In this guide, we will look at how to profile the private execution of a transaction, allowing you to get the gate count of each private function within the transaction, including the kernel circuits.

## Prerequisites

- `aztec-nargo` installed (go to [Sandbox section](../../../reference/developer_references/sandbox_reference/sandbox-reference.md) for installation instructions)
- `aztec-wallet` installed (installed as part of the Sandbox)

## Profiling using aztec-wallet

The profiling tool is integrated into the `aztec-wallet`.

In this example, we will profile a simple "private token transfer" transaction which uses the [transfer](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/noir-projects/noir-contracts/contracts/token_contract/src/main.nr#L269) method in the token contract.
If you want to follow along, you'll need to clone the Aztec [monorepo](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages) and [compile](./how_to_compile_contract.md) the `token_contract` in `noir-projects/noir-contracts` by running `aztec-nargo compile --package token_contract`.

Let's deploy the necessary account and token contracts first:

```bash
# Deploy accounts
aztec-wallet create-account -a owner
aztec-wallet create-account -a user

# Deploy a token contract and mint 100 tokens to the user
# Run this from noir-projects/noir-contracts to determine the path to the token_contract
aztec-wallet deploy token_contract@Token --args accounts:owner Test TST 18 -f owner -a token
aztec-wallet send mint_to_private -ca token --args accounts:owner accounts:user 100 -f owner
```

Now, the `user` can transfer tokens by running:

```bash
# Send the tokens back to the owner
aztec-wallet send transfer -ca token --args accounts:owner 40 -f user
```

Instead of sending the above transaction, you can simulate it by running the `simulate` command with the same parameters, and then add a `--profile` flag to profile the gate count of each private function in the transaction.

For the time being, you also need to set `BB_BINARY_PATH` and `BB_WORKING_DIRECTORY` environment variables with the below values.

```bash
BB_BINARY_PATH=/usr/src/barretenberg/cpp/build/bin/bb BB_WORKING_DIRECTORY=~/.bb/work-dir aztec-wallet simulate --profile transfer -ca token --args accounts:owner 40 -f user
```

This will print the following results after some time:

```bash
Gate count per circuit:
   SchnorrAccount:entrypoint                          Gates: 26,487     Acc: 26,487
   private_kernel_init                                Gates: 48,562     Acc: 75,049
   Token:transfer                                     Gates: 32,869     Acc: 107,918
   private_kernel_inner                               Gates: 89,062     Acc: 196,980
   private_kernel_reset                               Gates: 105,077    Acc: 302,057
   private_kernel_tail                                Gates: 27,501     Acc: 329,558

Total gates: 329,558
```

Here you can see the gate count of each private function call in the transaction along with the kernel circuits needed in between, and the total gate count.

This will help you understand which parts of your transaction are bottlenecks and optimize the contract logic accordingly.


## Flamegraph

While the `aztec-wallet` provides a way to profile the gate count of each private function in a transaction, flamegraph tool lets you visualize the gate count of each operation within a private function.

You can run the flamegraph tool by running the following command:

```bash
aztec flamegraph <artifact_path> <function_name>
```

For example, if you want to flamegraph the `cast_vote` function [aztec-starter](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-starter/blob/main/src/main.nr), you can do

```bash
aztec-nargo compile
aztec flamegraph target/easy_private_voting_contract-EasyPrivateVoting.json cast_vote
```

This will generate a flamegraph of the `cast_vote` function and save the output svg to the `target` directory. You can open the svg file in your browser to visualize the flamegraph.

You can also run the same command with `SERVE=1` to serve the flamegraph on a local server.

```bash
SERVE=1 aztec flamegraph target/easy_private_voting_contract-EasyPrivateVoting.json cast_vote
```
This will serve the flamegraph on `http://localhost:8000`.
