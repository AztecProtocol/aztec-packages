## Prerequisite reading

- [Keys Concept](../../../../../aztec/concepts/accounts/keys.md)

## Introduction

It is possible for users to rotate their keys, which can be helpful if some of their keys are leaked.

Because of this, notes are associated with their `nullifier key` rather than any sort of 'owner' address. 

It is still possible to nullify the notes with the old nullifier key even after the key rotation.

## Things to consider

- 'Owner' is arbitrary - as long as you know the nullifier secret, you can nullify a note
- Consider how key rotation can affect account contracts, eg you can add additional security checks for who or how the key rotation is called

- `nsk_hash`: nullifying secret key hash
- `ivpk_m`: incoming view public key (master) (learn more about IVPKs [here](../../../../../aztec/concepts/accounts/keys.md#incoming-viewing-keys))
