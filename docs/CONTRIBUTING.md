## Docusaurus

This site is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs).

> üßê Docusaurus is a static-site generator. It builds a single-page application with fast client-side navigation, leveraging the full power of React to make your site interactive. It provides out-of-the-box documentation features but can be used to create any kind of site (personal website, product, blog, marketing landing pages, etc).

If you have questions about how Docusaurus works, consult their [documentation](https://docusaurus.io/docs) before you contribute.

## Creating pages

Write pages in markdown. [Docusaurus reference](https://docusaurus.io/docs/creating-pages#add-a-markdown-page).

When you create a new page, the file path must be added to `./sidebars.js` for the page to be rendered on the site. 

### Front-matter

Markdown front matter should include a title at minimum.

```md
---
title: Page title
---
```

### Adding images

When adding images, update the page extension to be [.mdx](https://mdxjs.com/).

Import [Ideal image](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-ideal-image) to the page.

```ts
import Image from '@theme/IdealImage';
```

Add the image with the path to the image in `./static/img/`.

```ts
<Image img={require('/img/proofs-on-proofs.png')} />
```

Things to note:

- If you want to modify anything related to the sidebar pages tree, modify `./sidebars.js`. Consult [these docs](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar) for reference.
- The search on the Docusaurus documentation site is excellent. Try searching for the topic in question.

When in doubt, check existing sections of the code to see if there are relevant references.
