* To write LaTeX in VSCode, use the LaTeX Workship extension by James Wu. It gives syntax highlighting, error squiggles, compile debug logs, and a little button at the top-right of the tex file to preview your code as a pdf (I keep this preview window open all the time).

* Thanks to Patrick for this LaTeX template!

* All .tex files except for the main one should be in the ./tex_files sub-directory.

* File names are in lower-cases characters with underscores to separate words.

* Add packages in the ./tex_files/header.tex file, with a comment explaining what the package enables.

* Add new commands in the ./tex_files/new_commands.tex file and follow the organisation therein.

* Start each new sentence on a new line (in LaTeX code).

* Indent (in LaTeX code) itemisations.

* Wrap at 120 characters.

* Use paragraphs, sub-sub-sections, \textbf{}, indentations (in LaTeX code) and itemisations to make both the compiled PDF and the LaTex code visually
  clear. 

* Take the time to simplify the notation as much as possible!
