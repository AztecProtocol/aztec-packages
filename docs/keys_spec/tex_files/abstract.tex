	Specs for:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Master key derivation
		\item App-siloed nullifier key derivation
		\item Encryption
		\item Decryption
		\item Handshaking \& Tagging
		\item Log Layout (not started)
	\end{itemize}
	\noindent\\
	The intention is to use this doc to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Discuss uncertainties with the Crypto Research team.
		\item Explore optimisations (in constraint counts, data broadcast size, privacy).
		\item Come up with a final spec that we're all happy with.
		\item Get sign-off on the correctness and security of these schemes from the Crypto Research team.
	\end{itemize}
