title: How to run a Validator/Sequencer Node

It is recommended to read the concepts before running a node, specifically the [provers and sequencers](../../concepts/provers-and-sequencers/index.md) section.

As we are in active development, this guide is actively changing. Please refer to [this README](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/spartan/releases/README.md) for the latest information.
