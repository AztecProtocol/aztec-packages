# Connecting to the Private eXecution Environment (PXE)

PXE is a component of the Aztec Protocol that provides a private execution environment for your application.

As an app developer, the PXE interface provides you with access to the user's accounts and their private state, as well as a connection to the network for accessing public global state.

The Aztec Sandbox (reference [here](../../../../reference/environment_reference/sandbox-reference.md)) runs a local PXE and an Aztec Node, both connected to a local Ethereum development node like Anvil.

The Sandbox also includes a set of pre-initialized accounts that you can use from your app.

In this section, we'll connect to the Sandbox from our project.

## Create PXE client

We'll use the `createPXEClient` function from `aztec.js` to connect to the Sandbox.
Sandbox exposes a HTTP JSON-RPC interface of PXE.
By default it runs on `localhost:8080`.
To test the connection works, we'll request and print the node's chain id.

Let's create our first file `src/index.mjs` with the following contents:

```javascript title="all" showLineNumbers 
import { createPXEClient } from '@aztec/aztec.js';

const { PXE_URL = 'http://localhost:8080' } = process.env;

async function main() {
  const pxe = await createPXEClient(PXE_URL);
  const { l1ChainId } = await pxe.getNodeInfo();
  console.log(`Connected to chain ${l1ChainId}`);
}

main().catch(err => {
  console.error(`Error in app: ${err}`);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

Make sure the [Sandbox is running](../../../../getting_started.md) and run the example

```bash
node src/index.mjs
```

and you should see the following output:

```
Connected to chain 31337
```

:::info
Should the above fail due to a connection error, make sure the Sandbox is running locally and on port 8080.

## Load user accounts

In sandbox PXE comes with a set of pre-initialized accounts that you can use from your app.
Let's try loading the accounts:

```javascript title="showAccounts" showLineNumbers 
async function showAccounts(pxe) {
  const accounts = await pxe.getRegisteredAccounts();
  console.log(`User accounts:\n${accounts.map(a => a.address).join('\n')}`);
}
```

Call the `showAccounts` function from `main`, run again the above, and you should see something like:

```
User accounts:
0x0c8a6673d7676cc80aaebe7fa7504cf51daa90ba906861bfad70a58a98bf5a7d
0x226f8087792beff8d5009eb94e65d2a4a505b70baf4a9f28d33c8d620b0ba972
0x0e1f60e8566e2c6d32378bdcadb7c63696e853281be798c107266b8c3a88ea9b
```

## Next steps

With a working connection to PXE, let's now setup our application by [compiling and deploying our contracts](./2_contract_deployment.md).
