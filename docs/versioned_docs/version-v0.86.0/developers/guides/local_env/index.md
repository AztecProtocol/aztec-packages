It is recommended to build and test your app on a local network before deploying to testnet. You can find instructions on how to run and interact with a local network in the [quickstart](../../getting_started.md).

In this section, you will find guides for installing and using tools in the Aztec toolbox. We refer to the local network + toolbox + local PXE as the Sandbox, so expect to see this word.
