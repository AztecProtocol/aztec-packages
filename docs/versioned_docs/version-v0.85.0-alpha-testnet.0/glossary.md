### Barretenberg

### bb / bb.js

`bb` (CLI) and its corresponding `bb.js` (node module) are tools that prove and verify circuits. It also has helpful functions such as: writing solidity verifier contracts, checking a witness, and viewing a circuit's gate count.

### `nargo`

With `nargo`, you can start new projects, compile, execute, and test your Noir programs.

You can find more information in the nargo installation docs [here](https://noir-lang.org/docs/getting_started/installation/) and the nargo command reference [here](https://noir-lang.org/docs/reference/nargo_commands).

### Noir

<Glossary.Noir />

### Noir Language Server

The Noir Language Server can be used in vscode to facilitate writing programs in Noir by providing syntax highlighting, circuit introspection and an execution interface. The Noir LSP addon allows the dev to choose their tool, nargo or aztec-nargo, when writing a pure Noir program or an Aztec smart contract.

You can find more info about the LSP [in the Noir docs](https://noir-lang.org/docs/tooling/language_server).

### Node

<Glossary.AztecNode />

To run your own node see [here](./run_node/guides/run_nodes/index.md).

### Note

In Aztec, a Note is encrypted information stored by nodes in the network. Data in a note (once decrypted) may represent some variable's state at a point in time.

### Provers

Aztec will be launched with a fully permissionless proving network that anyone can participate in.

How this works will be discussed via a future RFP process on Discourse, similarly to the Sequencer RFP.

### Private Execution Environment (PXE)

<Glossary.PXE />

Read more [here](./aztec/concepts/pxe/index.md).

### Sandbox

<Glossary.AztecSandbox />

### Sequencer

Aztec will be launched with a fully permissionless sequencer network that anyone can participate in.

How this works is being discussed actively in the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.aztec.network/t/request-for-proposals-decentralized-sequencer-selection/350/). Once this discussion process is completed, we will update the glossary and documentation with specifications and instructions for how to run.

Sequencers are generally responsible for:

- Selecting pending transactions from the mempool
- Ordering transactions into a block
- Verifying all private transaction proofs and execute all public transactions to check their validity
- Computing the ROLLUP_BLOCK_REQUEST_DATA
- Computing state updates for messages between L2 & L1
- Broadcasting the ROLLUP_BLOCK_REQUEST_DATA to the prover network via the proof pool for parallelizable computation.
- Building a rollup proof from completed proofs in the proof pool
- Tagging the pending block with an upgrade signal to facilitate forks
- Publishing completed block with proofs to Ethereum as an ETH transaction

Previously in [Aztec Connect](https://medium.com/aztec-protocol/sunsetting-aztec-connect-a786edce5cae) there was a single sequencer, and you can find the Typescript reference implementation called Falafel [here](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-connect/tree/master/yarn-project/falafel).

### Smart Contracts

Programs that run on the Aztec network are called smart contracts, similar to [programs](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/) that run on Ethereum.

However, these will be written in the [Noir](https://noir-lang.org/index.html) programming language, and may optionally include private state and private functions.

### Testing eXecution Environment (TXE)

<Glossary.TXE />

### Proving Key

A key that is used to generate a proof. In the case of Aztec, these are compiled from Noir smart contracts.

### Verification Key

A key that is used to verify the validity of a proof generated from a proving key from the same smart contract.
