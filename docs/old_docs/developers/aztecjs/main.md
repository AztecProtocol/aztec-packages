## Introduction
Aztec.js is a library that provides APIs for managing accounts and interacting with contracts on the Aztec network. It communicates with the [Private eXecution Environment (PXE)](https://docs.aztec.network/apis/pxe/interfaces/PXE) through a `PXE` implementation, allowing developers to easily register new accounts, deploy contracts, view functions, and send transactions.
