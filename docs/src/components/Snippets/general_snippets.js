  Account: () => (
    <p>
      An account on Aztec is a smart contract that specifies a method of

      A fee paying contract (FPC) effectively implements fee abstraction. It is

    <p>
      The fee asset is only transferrable within a block to the current

      third party developer made asset portals and to ensure local compliance
      rules can be followed.

export const Tx_Teardown_Phase = () => (
  <p>
    Transactions can optionally have a "teardown" phase as part of their public
    execution, during which the "transaction fee" is available to public

    "refund", e.g. contracts that facilitate fee abstraction.

  <p>
    For convenience, the sandbox comes with 3 initial accounts that are

  <p>
    Fees are an integral part of any protocol's design. Proper fee pricing
