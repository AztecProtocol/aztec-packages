  Noir: () => (
    <p>
      Noir is a Domain Specific Language for SNARK proving systems. It is used
      for writing smart contracts in Aztec because private functions on Aztec
      are implemented as SNARKs to support privacy-preserving operations.
    </p>
  ),

  PXE: () => (
    <p>
      A client-side key manager, private contract storage, and Private eXecution
      Environment for private transactions. A PXE is a core part of an Aztec
      wallet and Sandbox, but can be decoupled and run independently.
    </p>

  AztecNode: () => (
    <p>
      A prover/sequencer that is part of a decentralised Aztec network. The
      Aztec testnet rolls up to Ethereum Sepolia.

  AztecSandbox: () => (
    <p>
      The Aztec Sandbox runs a set of Aztec tools for convenient local
      development, it includes: an Ethereum node, an Aztec node, and PXE.
    </p>

  AztecWalletCLI: () => (
    <p>
      The Aztec Wallet is a CLI wallet, <code>aztec-wallet</code>, that allows a
      user to manage accounts and interact with an Aztec network. It includes a
      PXE.
    </p>

  Account: () => (
    <p>
      An account on Aztec is a smart contract that specifies a method of
      authentication and a method of payment, allowing it to be used by the
      protocol to perform a transaction.
    </p>

  TXE: () => (
    <p>
      TXE stands for Test eXecution Environment. It enables rapid Aztec contract
      development by using "cheatcodes" in the Aztec Sandbox that manipulate
      state. For convenience, similar "cheatcodes" to manipulate Anvil's EVM
      state are wrapped.

  FPC: () => (
    <p>
      A fee paying contract (FPC) effectively implements fee abstraction. It is
      a contract that pays for transactions of other accounts, when its own
      custom criteria is met.

  ),

  FeeAsset_NonTransferrable: () => (
    <p>
      The fee asset is only transferrable within a block to the current
      sequencer, as it powers the fee abstraction mechanism on Aztec. The asset
      is not transferable beyond this to ensure credible neutrality between all
      third party developer made asset portals and to ensure local compliance
      rules can be followed.

export const Tx_Teardown_Phase = () => (
  <p>
    Transactions can optionally have a "teardown" phase as part of their public
    execution, during which the "transaction fee" is available to public
    functions. This is useful to transactions/contracts that need to compute a
    "refund", e.g. contracts that facilitate fee abstraction.
  </p>

export const CLI_Add_Test_Accounts = () => (
  <p>
    For convenience, the sandbox comes with 3 initial accounts that are
    prefunded, helping bootstrap payment of any transaction. To use them, you
    will need to add them to your pxe/wallet.

export const Why_Fees = () => (
  <p>
    Fees are an integral part of any protocol's design. Proper fee pricing
    contributes to the longevity and security of a network, and the fee payment
    mechanisms available inform the types of applications that can be built.

export const CLI_Fees = () => (
  <p>
    The CLI tool <code>aztec-wallet</code> takes the fee payment method via the

  <p>
    The <code>Gas</code> and <code>GasFees</code> types each specify Data
    availability and L2 cost components, so the settings are:

      <li>gasLimits: DA and L2 gas limits</li>
      <li>
        teardownGasLimits: DA and L2 gas limits for a txs optional teardown
