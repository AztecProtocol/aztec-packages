# This is a slightly odd location for this Dockerfile, as ostensibly it should belong next to the tests themselves.
# However, the noir subrepo has no concept of the aztec build pipeline, so the Dockerfile wouldn't make sense there.
# So, it lives here.
# This chains off the nargo build, and creates a container with a compiled set of acir tests.
