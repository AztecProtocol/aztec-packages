# Solidity Verifier contracts and tests

**Note:** ONLY Ultra verifier as rolled versions were removed. [aztec-verifier-contracts](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-verifier-contracts) contains old code with rolled standard verifier and tests. 


This folder contains verifier contracts and testing harnesses that are used by [Noir, our Zero-Knowledge Programming Language](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir).

The implementations maintain the same interface, regardless of the verifier flavour (Standard, Turbo, Ultra), this should enable upstream implementations to be "plug-and-play".

The verifier will follow an overall architecture below, consisting of 3 contracts/libraries. Namely, the verifier algorithm (stable across circuits), the verification key (circuit dependent) and then the "verifier instance", a base that reads from the verification key and uses the key's values in the verification algorithm. The main advantage of this design is that we can generate verification key's per circuit and plug them into a general verification algorithm.

![Verifier architecture](./figures/verifier.png)

The verification key is currently generated via [Barretenberg](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/barretenberg/blob/master/cpp/src/aztec/proof_system/verification_key/sol_gen.hpp), Aztec's backend for generating proofs.

## Current implementations

- UltraPlonK (see `src/ultra`)

## Generating Verification Keys and Proofs

Run `bootstrap.sh` to clone git submodules, download SRS and generate verification keys, relies on barretenberg already being compiled (run `./bootstrap` in `cpp`). The bootstrap will also install foundry to `./.foundry` so you can use `./.foundry/bin/forge` if you don't already have foundry installed.

# Tests

Test are performed with a `TestBase` harness, it provides helpers for reading files and printing proofs. The tests also require proofs and verification keys, those are build as part of the `bootstrap.sh`.

Note that foundry is set to just run 1 fuzz run, this is mainly to limit the duty for CI, and then it can be hammered more heavily when needed.

## How To Run the Tests?

To run all tests, run the following scripts at the root of the repo:

```bash
forge test --no-match-contract TestBase # add -(v, vv, vvv, vvvv) for verbosity of logs, no logs emitted as default
```

To run test for a specific Contract test,

```bash
forge test --match-contract <NAME_OF_CONTRACT> # e.g., StandardTest
```

To run a specific test

```bash
forge test --match-test <NAME_OF_TEST> # e.g., testValidProof
```

Example to run only `testValidProof` for the Standard verifier with logs:

```bash
forge test --match-contract StandardTest --match-test testValidProof -vvvv
```

## Debugging in assembly

Debugging from inside the assembly can be pretty inconvenient. The quickest way to get going is to add a custom error:
```solidity
bytes4 internal constant ERR_S = 0xf7b44074;
error ERR(bytes32,bytes32,bytes32);
```
Where `ERR_S` is the selector (first 4 bytes of keccak256(function signature)).

To revert the contract, and print values, you can then do as
```solidity
mstore(0x00, ERR_S) // put the selector in memory
mstore(0x04, val_1) // add first value after selector
mstore(0x24, val_2) // add second value after first
mstore(0x44, val_3) // add third value after second
revert(0x00, 0x64)  // revert with a message containing 0x64 bytes defined above
```
When running a test, you will then see the three values `val_1, val_2, val_3` in the console.

# Docker
To run the docker image, which will build keygen and proofgen and then run tests, run the following from root:
```bash
# From root 
docker build . -f sol/Dockerfile
```
