This guide shows you how to prove recursive programs using `bb.js`. We will be using Noir as the frontend language.

For the sake of clarity, it is assumed that:

- You already have a NoirJS app. If you don't, please visit the [NoirJS tutorial](https://noir-lang.org/docs/tutorials/noirjs_app) and the [reference](https://noir-lang.org/docs/reference/NoirJS/noir_js).
- You are familiar with what are recursive proofs and you have read the [recursion explainer](../explainers/recursive_aggregation.md)
- You already built a recursive circuit following [the reference](https://noir-lang.org/docs/noir/standard_library/recursion), and understand how it works.

It is also assumed that you're **not** using `noir_wasm` for compilation, and instead you've used [`nargo compile`](https://noir-lang.org/docs/reference/nargo_commands#nargo-compile) to generate the `json` you're now importing into your project.

## Step 1: Setup

In a standard recursive app, you're dealing with at least two circuits:

- `main` or `inner`: a circuit of type `assert(x != y)`, which we want to embed in another circuit recursively.
- `recursive` or `outer`: a circuit that verifies `main`.

First, let's import the necessary modules and set up our circuits:

#include_code imports examples/recursive.test.ts typescript

Then we need to load our circuit bytecode and set up the Noir instances:

#include_code setup examples/recursive.test.ts typescript

The first program can be anything, so we should focus on the second one. The circuit could be something like so:

```rust
global HONK_VK_SIZE: u32 = 112;
global HONK_PROOF_SIZE: u32 = 456;
global HONK_IDENTIFIER: u32 = 1;

fn main(
    verification_key: [Field; HONK_VK_SIZE],
    proof: [Field; HONK_PROOF_SIZE],
    public_inputs: pub [Field; 1],
) {
    std::verify_proof_with_type(
        verification_key,
        proof,
        public_inputs,
        0x0,
        HONK_IDENTIFIER,
    );
}
```

A common scenario is one where you want to create a proof of multiple proof verifications, like a binary tree. Some projects and demos like [billion zk voters](https://github.com/jordan-public/billion-zk-voters) and [the 2023 progcrypto activation demo](https://github.com/signorecello/progcrypto23-act) are examples of 2-in-1 circuits.

:::info Proof Types

Different proof systems can have different proof and VK sizes and types. You need to plan this in advance depending on your proof.

In this case we're using the default HONK proof.

:::

## Step 2: Witness generation

As with every Noir program, you need to execute it and generate the witness. This is no different from a regular `noir.js` program, except you want to do it twice:

#include_code witness_generation examples/recursive.test.ts typescript

:::warning

Noir will generate a witness which doesn't mean it is constrained or valid. The proving backend (in this case Barretenberg) is responsible for the generation of the proof.

This is why you should refer this technique as "recursive aggregation" instead of "recursion".

:::

:::warning

Always keep in mind what is actually happening on your development process, otherwise you'll quickly become confused about what circuit we are actually running and why!

In this case, you can imagine that Alice (running the `main` circuit) is proving something to Bob (running the `recursive` circuit), and Bob is verifying her proof within his proof.

With this in mind, it becomes clear that our intermediate proof is the one *meant to be verified within another circuit*, so it must be Alice's. Actually, the only final proof in this theoretical scenario would be the last one, sent on-chain.

:::

## Step 3 - Proving Backend

With the witness, we are now moving into actually proving. In this example, we will be using `bb.js` for generating the proof and the verification key of the inner circuit.

Since we're using Honk proofs, let's instantiate the UltraHonkBackend just as in the [browser how-to-guide](./on-the-browser.md):

#include_code backend_setup examples/recursive.test.ts typescript

:::tip

We're setting 8 threads here, but you can use the `os.cpus()` object in nodejs or `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` on the browser to make the most out of those cpu cores

:::

We can now generate the proof and the verification key (VK), for example:

#include_code proof_generation examples/recursive.test.ts typescript

:::info

One common mistake is to forget *who* generates the verification key.

In a situation where Alice and Bob are playing a battleships game and Alice is proving to Bob that he shot an aircraft carrier, **Bob** should generate the verification key himself. If Bob just accepts the proof and the VK from Alice, this means Alice could prove any circuit (i.e. 1 != 2) instead of the actual "proof that Bob sinked my ship"

:::

We now need to prepare our inputs to be fed correctly into the recursive program. This means getting the VK and the proof as fields. We can use the default Barretenberg API for this:

#include_code recursive_inputs examples/recursive.test.ts typescript

## Step 4 - Recursive proof generation

Having the proof and the VK in the correct format, generating a recursive proof is no different from a normal proof. You simply use the `backend` (with the recursive circuit) to generate it:

#include_code recursive_proof examples/recursive.test.ts typescript

You can obviously chain this proof into another proof. In fact, if you're using recursive proofs, you're probably interested of using them this way!

## Example

You can find a non-exaustive example of recursive aggregation in the [noir-examples](https://github.com/noir-lang/noir-examples/tree/master/recursion) repository.

Keep in mind that recursive proof aggregation is very much an experimental way of using Barretenberg, and you may need to tweak or downgrade versions.
