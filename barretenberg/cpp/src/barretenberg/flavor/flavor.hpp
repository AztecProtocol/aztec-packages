/**
 * @file flavor.hpp
 * @brief Base class templates for structures that contain data parameterized by the fundamental polynomials of a Honk
 * variant (a "flavor").
 *
 * @details #Motivation
 * We choose the framework set out in these classes for several reasons.
 *
 * For one, it allows for a large amount of the information of a Honk flavor to be read at a glance in a single file.
 *
 * The primary motivation, however, is to reduce the sort loose of coupling that is a significant source of complexity
 * in the original plonk code. There, we find many similarly-named entities defined in many different places (to name
 * some: selector_properties; FooSelectors; PolynomialIndex; the labels given to the polynomial store; the commitment
 * label; inconsistent terminology and notation around these), and it can be difficult to discover or remember the
 * relationships between these. We aim for a more uniform treatment, to enfore identical and informative naming, and to
 * prevent the developer having to think very much about the ordering of protocol entities in disparate places.
 *
 * Another motivation is iterate on the polynomial manifest of plonk, which is nice in its compactness, but which feels
 * needlessly manual and low-level. In the past, this contained even more boolean parameters, making it quite hard to
 * parse. A typical construction is to loop over the polynomial manifest by extracting a globally-defined
 * "FOO_MANIFEST_SIZE" (the use of "manifest" here is distinct from the manifests in the transcript) to loop
 * over a C-style array, and then manually parsing the various tags of different types in the manifest entries. We
 * greatly enrich this structure by using basic C++ OOP functionality. Rather than recording the polynomial source in an
 * enum, we group polynomial handles using getter functions in our new class. We get code that is more compact,
 * more legible, and which is safer because it admits ranged `for` loops.
 *
 * Another motivation is proper and clear specification of Honk variants. The flavors are meant to be explicit and
 * easily comparable. In plonk, the various settings template parameters and objects like the CircuitType enum became
 * overloaded in time, and continue to be a point of accumulation for tech debt. We aim to remedy some of this by
 * putting proving system information in the flavor, and circuit construction information in the arithmetization (or
 * larger circuit constructor class).
 *
 * @details #Data model
 * All of the flavor classes derive from a single Entities_ template, which simply wraps a std::array (we would
 * inherit, but this is unsafe as std::array has a non-virtual destructor). The developer should think of every flavor
 * class as being:
 *  - A std::array<DataType, N> instance called _data.
 *  - An informative name for each entry of _data that is fixed at compile time.
 *  - Some classic metadata like we'd see in plonk (e.g., a circuit size, a reference string, an evaluation domain).
 *  - A collection of getters that record subsets of the array that are of interest in the Honk variant.
 *
 * Each getter returns a container of HandleType's, where a HandleType is a value type that is inexpensive to create and
 * that lets one view and mutate a DataType instance. The primary example here is that std::span is the handle type
 * chosen for barrtenberg::Polynomial.
 *
 * @details #Some Notes
 *
 * @note It would be ideal to codify more structure in these base class template and to have it imposed on the actual
 * flavors, but our inheritance model is complicated as it is, and we saw no reasonable way to fix this.
 *
 * @note One asymmetry to note is in the use of the term "key". It is worthwhile to distinguish betwen prover/verifier
 * circuit data, and "keys" that consist of such data augmented with witness data (whether, raw, blinded, or polynomial
 * commitments). Currently the proving key contains witness data, while the verification key does not.
 * TODO(Cody): It would be nice to resolve this but it's not essential.
 *
 * @note The VerifierCommitments classes are not 'tight' in the sense that that the underlying array contains(a few)
 * empty slots. This is a conscious choice to limit complexity. Note that there is very little memory cost here since
 * the DataType size in that case is small.
 *
 * @todo TODO(#395): Getters should return arrays?
 * @todo TODO(#396): Access specifiers?
 * @todo TODO(#397): Use more handle types?
 * @todo TODO(#398): Selectors should come from arithmetization.
