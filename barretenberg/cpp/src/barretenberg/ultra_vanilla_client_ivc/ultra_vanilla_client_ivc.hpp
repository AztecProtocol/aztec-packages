/**
 * @brief A function that produces a set of circuits and possibly their precomputed vks
 * @details One has the option of not providing vks--just provide nullptr instead.
 *    This class is introduced as an experiment. We _could_ just use vectors of vks and shared_ptrs, but this limits
 * applicability of the class because, in practice, we don't have sufficient memory to store all circuit builders at
 * once.  The idea is this class is applicable in both situations we care about testing via mocks (cf the test file for
 * UltraVanillaClientIVC, which implements a source of mock circuits), and IVC of circuits written in Noir, where the
 * source (not yet implemented) is ACIR and partial witnesses which are processed by our DSL code, expanding blackbox
 * function calls.
 * @todo Relocate this at the appropriate time, if it does become a standard interface.
