/**
 * @brief MSM relations that evaluate the Strauss multiscalar multiplication algorithm.
 *
 * @details
 * The Straus algorithm for a size-k MSM takes scalars/points (a_i, [P_i]) for i = 0 to k-1.
 * The specific algorithm we use is may be found in the README in the `eccvm` directory. We briefly reprise the
 * algorithm nonetheless.
 *
 * PHASE 1: Precomputation (performed in ecc_wnaf_relation.hpp, ecc_point_table_relation.hpp)
 * Each scalar a_i is split into 4-bit WNAF slices s_{j, i} for j = 0 to 31, and a skew bool skew_i
 * For each point [P_i] a size-16 lookup table of points, T_i, is computed { [-15 P_i], [-13 P_i], ..., [15 P_i] }
 *
 * PHASE 2: MSM evaluation
 * MSM evaluation is split into 32 rounds that operate on an accumulator point [Acc]
 * The first 31 rounds are composed of an ADDITION round and a DOUBLE round.
 * The final 32nd round is composed of an ADDITION round and a SKEW round.
 *
 * ADDITION round (round = j):
 * [Acc] = [Acc] + T_i[a_{i, j}] for all i in [0, ... k-1]
 *
 * DOUBLE round:
 * [Acc] = 16 * [Acc] (four point doublings)
 *
 * SKEW round:
 * If skew_i == 1, [Acc] = [Acc] - [P_i] for all i in [0, ..., k - 1]
 *
 * The relations in ECCVMMSMRelationImpl constrain the ADDITION, DOUBLE and SKEW rounds
 * @param evals transformed to `evals + C(in(X)...)*scaling_factor`
 * @param in an std::array containing the fully extended Accumulator edges.
 * @param parameters contains beta, gamma, and public_input_delta, ....
 * @param scaling_factor optional term to scale the evaluation before adding to evals.

    /**
     * @brief Constraining addition rounds
     *
     * The boolean column q_add describes whether a round is an ADDITION round.
     * The values of q_add are Prover-defined. We need to ensure they set q_add correctly. We will do this via a
     * multiset-equality check (formerly called a "strict lookup"), which allows the various tables to "communicate".
     * On a high level, we ensure that this table "reads" (pc, round, wnaf_slice), another table (PointTable) "writes" a
     * potentially different set of (pc, round, wnaf_slice), and we demand that the reads match the writes.
     * Alternatively said, the MSM columns spawn a multiset of tuples of the form (pc, round, wnaf_slice), the
     * PointTable columns span a potentially different multiset of tuples of the form (pc, round, wnaf_slice), and we
     * _check_ that these two multisets match.
     *
     * We rely on the following statements that we assume are constrained to be true (from other relations):
     *      1. The set of reads into (pc, round, wnaf_slice) is constructed when q_add = 1
     *      2. The set of reads into (pc, round, wnaf_slice) must match the set of writes from the point_table columns
     *      3. The set of writes into (pc, round, wnaf_slice) from the point table columns is correct
     *      4. `round` only updates when `q_add = 1` at current row and `q_add = 0` at next row
     * If a Prover sets `q_add = 0` when an honest Prover would set `q_add = 1`,
     * this will produce an inequality in the set of reads / writes into the (pc, round, wnaf_slice) table.
     *
     * The addition algorithm has several IF/ELSE statements based on comparing `count` with `msm_size`.
     * Instead of directly constraining these, we define 4 boolean columns `q_add1, q_add2, q_add3, q_add4`.
     * Like `q_add`, their values are Prover-defined. We need to ensure they are set correctly.
     * We update the above conditions on reads into (pc, round, wnaf_slice) to the following:
     *      1. The set of reads into (pc_{count}, round, wnaf_slice_{count}) is constructed when q_add = 1 AND q_add1 =
     * 1
     *      2. The set of reads into (pc_{count + 1}, round, wnaf_slice_{count + 1}) is constructed when q_add = 1 AND
     * q_add2 = 1
     *      3. The set of reads into (pc_{count + 2}, round, wnaf_slice_{count + 2}) is constructed when q_add = 1 AND
     * q_add3 = 1
     *      4. The set of reads into (pc_{count + 3}, round, wnaf_slice_{count + 3}) is constructed when q_add = 1 AND
     * q_add4 = 1
     *
     * To ensure that all q_addi values are correctly set we apply consistency/continuity checks to
     * q_add1/q_add2/q_add3/q_add4:
     * 1. If q_add2 = 1, require q_add1 = 1
     * 2. If q_add3 = 1, require q_add2 = 1
     * 3. If q_add4 = 1, require q_add3 = 1
     * 4. If q_add1_shift = 1 AND round does not update between rows, require q_add4 = 1
     *
     * We want to use all of the above to reason about the set of reads into (pc, round, wnaf_slice).
     * The goal is to conclude that any case where the Prover incorrectly sets q_add/q_add1/q_add2/q_add3/q_add4 will
     * produce a set inequality between the reads/writes into (pc, round, wnaf_slice)

     * @brief Addition relation

     * All addition operations in ECCVMMSMRelationImpl are conditional additions, as we sometimes want to add values and
     * other times simply want to propagate values. (consider, e.g., when `q_add2 == 0`.) This method returns two
     * Accumulators that represent x/y coord of output. Output is either an addition of inputs (if `selector == 1`), or
     * xa/ya (if `selector == 0`). Additionally, we require `lambda = 0` if `selector = 0`. The `collision_relation`
     * accumulator tracks a subrelation that validates xb != xa.
     * Repeated calls to this method will increase the max degree of the Accumulator output:
     * deg(x_out) = 1 + max(deg(xa, xb)), deg(y_out) = max(1 + deg(x_out), 1 + deg(ya))

     * degree 5 and the final y_out will have degree 6.
