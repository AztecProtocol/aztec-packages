 * 1) Create a copy of this class and rename it
 * 2) Update all the values with the ones needed for your lookup
 * 3) Update "DECLARE_LOOKUP_IMPLEMENTATIONS_FOR_ALL_SETTINGS" and "DEFINE_LOOKUP_IMPLEMENTATIONS_FOR_ALL_SETTINGS" to
 * include the new settings
 * 4) Add the relation with the chosen settings to Relations in the flavor (for example,"`
 *   using Relations = std::tuple<GenericLookupRelation<ExampleXorLookupSettings,
