     * @brief Given a set of points and sequence counts, peform addition to reduce each sequence to a single point
     * @details Reduce each sequence to a single point via repeated rounds of pairwise addition. (If the length
     * of the sequence is odd in a given round, the unpaired point is simply carried over to the next round). The
     * inverses needed in the addition formula are batch computed in a single go for all additions to be performed
     * across all sequences in a given round.
     * @note: Multithreading is achieved by evenly distributing the points across the optimal number of available
     * threads. This can result in the bisecting of some sequences which is acounted for in the final result by further
     * summing the reduced points that resulted from a sequence split across two or more threads. An example with two
     * threads and three add sequences:
     *
     *                     |------------------------| Points
     *                     |------------|-----------| Thread boundaries

     *                     | 0 |    1   | 1 |   2   | Tags
     *
     * Each thread recieves two add sequences and reduces them to two points. The resulting four points are further
     * reduced to three by summing points that share a sequence tag.
