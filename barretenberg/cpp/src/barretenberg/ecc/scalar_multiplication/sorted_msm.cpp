/**
 * @brief Reduce MSM inputs such that the set of scalars contains no duplicates by summing points which share a scalar.
 * @details Since point addition is substantially cheaper than scalar multiplication, it is more efficient in some cases
 * to first sum all points which share a scalar then perform the MSM on the reduced set of inputs. This is achieved via
 * the following procedure:
 *
 * 1) Sort the input {points, scalars} by scalar in order to group points into 'addition sequences' i.e. sets of points
 * to be added together prior to performing the MSM.
 *
 * 2) For each sequence, perform pairwise addition on all points. (If the length of the sequence is odd, the unpaired
 * point is simply carried over to the next round). The inverses needed in the addition formula are batch computed in a
 * single go for all additions to be performed across all sequences in a given round.
 *
 * 3) Perform rounds of pair-wise addition until each sequence is reduced to a single point.
