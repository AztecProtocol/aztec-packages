/**
 * @brief A shared pointer array template that represents a virtual array filled with zeros up to `virtual_size_`,
 * but with actual memory usage proportional to the region between `start_` and `end_`.
 *
 * This structure is designed to optimize memory usage by only allocating memory for a specific subrange
 * of the array. The `start_` and `end_` members define the range of indices that are backed by actual memory.
 * The rest of the indices, up to `virtual_size_`, are conceptually filled with zero values.
 *
 * The class allows for sharing the underlying array with potential offset adjustments, making it possible
 * to represent shifted arrays where the actual memory-backed range starts from a non-zero index.
 * It is designed to be wrapped by another class, namely `Polynomial`, and is not intended to be used directly.
 *
 * @tparam T The type of the elements in the array.
