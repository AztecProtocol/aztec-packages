    // ========= EXPLANATIONS =================================================
    // Main trick for arithmetic operations modulo 2^k is to perform the operation
    // over the integers and expressing the result as low + high * 2^k with low
    // smaller than 2^k. low is used as the output. This works as long this does
    // not underflow/overflow the underlying finite field order (u128 multiplication
    // will be handled differently). If we want to prove that c = OP(a,b) where OP
    // denotes an arithmetic operation modulo 2^k, we can achieve this with two relations:
    // (1) low + high * 2^k - OP'(a,b) = 0
    // (2) low - c = 0
    //
    // where OP' denotes the same operation as OP but over the integers (not mod 2^k).
    // We support u8, u16, u32, u64, u128 types and decompose low into
    // smaller bit slices, e.g., 16. For instance, low = s_0 + s_1 * 2^16 + s_2 * 2^32 + ...
    // The slices have to be range constrained and there is a trade-off between the
    // number of registers and complexity of the range constraints.
    //
    // Optimization: We will capture the relation (1) for all types under the same umbrella
    //               by re-using the decomposition used for u128 type for the lower types.
    //               This works because any larger power of 2^k divides 2^l whenever k <= l.
    //               To be able to express "low" for u8, we need a 8-bit limb for the lowest
    //               bits. A bit decomposition covering all types is:
    //  s8_0 + s8_1 * 2^8 + s16_0 * 2^16 + s16_1 * 2^32 ... + s16_6 * 2^112 + carry * 2^128 - OP'(a,b) = 0
    //               where s8_i's are 8-bit registers and s16's 16-bit registers.
    //               For type uk, we set low to the k-bit truncated part of register decomposition.
    //               As example, for u32: low = s8_0 + s8_1 * 2^8 + s16_0 * 2^16
    //               and for u8: low = s8_0
    //
    // TODO: It is open whether we might get efficiency gain to use larger registers for the higher
    //       parts of the bit decomposition.

    // Addition and subtraction relations are very similar and will be consolidated.
    // For the addition we have to replace OP'(a,b) in the above relation by a+b and
    // for subtraction by a-b. Using operation selector values to toggle "+b" vs. "-b"
    // makes the deal with the adaptation that the carry term needs to be subtracted
    // instead of being added. To sumarize, for the first relation, addition needs to
    // satisfy:
    // sum_128 + carry * 2^128 - a - b = 0
    // while the subtraction satisfies:
    // sum_128 - carry * 2^128 - a + b = 0
    //
    // Finally, we would like this relation to also satisfy the addition over the finite field.
    // For this, we add c in the relation conditoned by the ff type selector alu_ff_tag. We emphasize
    // that this relation alone for FF will not imply correctness of the FF addition. We only want
    // it to be satisfied. A separate relation will ensure correctness of it.
