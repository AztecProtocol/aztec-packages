As we develop more sophisticated SNARK proving systems for more demanding applications, we drift away from the basic specs as described in \cite Plonk  and \cite HONK. The purpose of these living protocol specs is to cleanly document these changes in a narrative form that lives alongside the code. 

It should be written explicitly that this is no substitute for thorough audits (external and internal) of the software and the protocol. Our goal here is to ease knowledge sharing and to make the auditors' jobs easier.
