 * @notice  This test is used to ensure that changes to L1 contracts don't go unnoticed.
 *          While still allowing the addition of more tests etc without having to update it.
 *          The test is fairly simple, check if the creation code has changed for the important
 *          contracts. If it has, the test will fail, so it needs to be updated.
 *          Updating this file should then notify the turtles, as they are the code owners of this file.
