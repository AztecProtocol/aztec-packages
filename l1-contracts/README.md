# L1 Contracts

This directory contains the Ethereum smart contracts for progressing the state of the Rollup.

## Installation

You can install foundry as https://book.getfoundry.sh/ or by running the `./bootstrap.sh` script.

Alternatively you can use docker instead, it will handle installations and run tests. Simply run `docker build .` from the `l1-contracts` folder.

## Structure

The `src` folder contain contracts that is to be used by the local developer testnet. It is grouped into 3 catagories:

- `core` contains the required contracts, the bare minimum
- `mock` contains stubs, for now an always true verifier.
- `periphery` stuff that is nice to have, convenience contracts and functions belong in here.

## Running tests

The tests are located in the `test` folder, and execute two consecutive L2Blocks. The blocks and the values they are checked against is generated using the block builder tests (there also is a typescript test in `l2-block-publisher.test.ts` that tests E2E). The tests are currently limited in functionality as it is mainly decoding happening, but will expand over time to include L1 <-> L2 communication and cross chain applications.

As mentioned earlier, you can also use docker. If you rerun `docker build .` after changing the contracts, it will use a cache for most values, and rerun your tests in a few seconds.

## Formatting

We use `forge fmt` to format. But follow a few general guidelines beyond the standard:

- use `_` prefix for function arguments, e.g.,
  - Don't `function transfer(address to, uint256 amount);`
  - Do `function transfer(address _to, uint256 _amount);`
- use `_` prefix for `internal` and `private` functions.

## Contracts:

The contracts are in a very early stage, and don't worry about gas costs right now. Instead they prioritise development velocity.

### Decoder

Job: Extract values from `L2Block`

The decoder is a core rollup contract which takes the `L2Block` bytes and computes/extracts values required to:

1. keep track of the state
1. perform proof verification

If the structure of the `L2Block` changes, so should the decoder!

### Rollup

Job: Keep track of state and perform state transitions.

It is the job of the rollup contract to store the state of the rollup and progress it when receiving a new L2 block that is built on top of the current state.

Currently not running any proofs _nor_ access control so blocks can be submitted by anyone and can be complete garbage.

### ContractDeploymentEmitter

Job: Share Contract Deployment public data on chain.

For now, this include bytecode for contract deployment, but over time this will be verified for public functions.

# Linter

We use an extended version of solhint (https://github.com/LHerskind/solhint) to include custom rules. These custom rules relate to how errors should be named, using custom errors instead of reverts etc, see `.solhint.json` for more specifics about the rules.

The linter is the only node module we need which is the reason behind not going full yarn-project on it. It is not part of the docker image, but can be run once in a while to make sure we are on track.

To run the linter, simply run:

```bash
yarn lint
```
