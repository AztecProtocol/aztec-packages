/**
 * @title RollupCore
 * @author Aztec Labs
 * @notice Core Aztec rollup contract that manages the L2 blockchain state, validator selection, and proof verification.
 *
 * @dev This is the main contract in the Aztec system that handles:
 *      - Block proposals from sequencers/proposers
 *      - Epoch proof submission and verification
 *      - Chain pruning and invalidation mechanisms
 *      - Validator and committee management
 *      - Fee collection and reward distribution
 *
 *      The rollup operates on a time-based model:
 *      - Time is divided into slots (configurable duration, e.g., 12 seconds)
 *      - Slots are grouped into epochs (configurable size, e.g., 32 slots)
 *      - Each slot has one designated proposer from the validator set
 *      - Each block is expected to include attestations from committee members
 *      - There is one committee per epoch
 *
 *      Key invariants:
 *      - The L2 chain is linear (no forks) but can be rolled back
 *        - New blocks must build on the state of the current pending block
 *      - Blocks with invalid attestations can be removed via the invalidation mechanism
 *      - Unproven blocks are pruned if no proof is submitted in time
 *
 * @dev Due to contract size limitations, not all functionality can be implemented in a single contract, so features
 *      are split across multiple ExtRollup external libraries.
 *
 * @dev System Roles
 *
 *      1) Validators: Node operators who have staked the staking asset and actively participate in block building.
 *         They form the pool from which committee members and proposers are selected.
 *
 *      2) Committee Members: Drafted from the validator set and remain stable throughout an epoch.
 *         A block requires >2/3rds of the committee for the epoch to be considered valid. These attestations serve two
 *         purposes:
 *         - Attest to data availability for transaction data not posted on L1, which is required by provers to generate
 *           epoch proofs
 *         - Re-execute everything and attest to the resulting state root, acting as training wheels for the public
 *           part of the system (proving systems used in public and AVM)
 *
 *      3) Proposers: Drafted from the validator set (currently proposers are part of the committee for the epoch,
 *         though this may change). They have exclusive rights to propose a block at a given slot, ensuring orderly
 *         block production without competition.
 *
 *      4) Provers: Generate validity proofs for the state transitions of blocks in an epoch. No need to stake to be a
 *         prover. They have access to large amounts of compute.
 *
 * @dev Block Building Flow
 *
 *      Relevant functions:
 *      - `propose`: Called by the proposer to submit a new block
 *      - `submitEpochRootProof`: Called by the prover to submit a proof of the epoch's state transitions
 *      - `invalidateBadAttestation`: Called to remove blocks with invalid attestations
 *      - `invalidateInsufficientAttestations`: Called to remove blocks with insufficient valid attestations
 *      - `prune`: Called to remove unproven blocks after the proof submission window has expired
 *      - `setupEpoch`: Called to initialize the validator selection for the next epoch
 *
 *      The block building flow is as follows:
 *
 *      - At each L2 slot a single proposer is chosen from the validator set who assembles a block that:
 *         - Builds on top of the last pending block (tips.pending) in the rollup
 *         - Includes state transitions, messages, and fee calculations
 *         - Is attested by >2/3 of the committee members
 *      - The L2 block is posted to L1 via the `propose` function
 *         - The pending chain tip advances to the new block
 *         - State is updated (message trees, archives, etc.)
 *      - After the epoch has ended, a prover generates a proof of the valid state transition for a prefix of blocks in
 *        the epoch
 *         - Most often the prefix will be all the blocks, but "partial epochs" can also be proven for faster message
 *           transmission
 *         - The proof is submitted via `submitEpochRootProof` and must be submitted within the configured proof
 *           submission window
 *         - Upon successful proof submission the proven chain tip advances to the last block in the proven prefix if it
 *           is past the current proven tip, otherwise the tip remain unchanged
 *         - It is possible to submit multiple proofs for the same epoch (or prefixes of it)
 *         - Provers of longest prefix shares the proving rewards
 *      - Proving a block makes it finalized from the perspective of L1
 *         - This triggers reward and fee accounting for the sequencers and provers of the epoch
 *         - And pushes messages to the outbox for L1 processing
 *
 *      Unhappy path for invalid attestations:
 *      - Attestations in blocks are not validated on-chain to save gas. Since attestations are still posted to L1,
 *        nodes are expected to verify them off-chain, and skip a block if its attestations are invalid.
 *      - If a block has invalid attestation signatures, anyone can call `invalidateBadAttestation()`
 *      - If a block has insufficient valid attestations (<= 2/3 of committee), anyone can call
 *        `invalidateInsufficientAttestations()`
 *      - While anyone can call invalidation functions, it is expected that the next proposer will do so, and if they
 *        fail to do so, then other committee members do, and if they fail to do so, then any validator will do so.
 *      - Upon invalidation, the invalid block and all subsequent blocks are removed from the chain, so the pending
 *        chain tip reverts to the block immediately before the invalid one.
 *       - Note that only unproven blocks can be invalidated, as proven blocks are final and cannot be reverted.
 *
 *      Unhappy path for missing proofs:
 *      - Each epoch has a proof submission window (configured via aztecProofSubmissionEpochs).
 *      - If no proof is submitted within the window, it is assumed that the epoch cannot be proven due to missing data,
 *        so the entire pending chain all the way back to the last proven block is pruned. This is done by calling
 *        `prune()` manually, or automatically on the next proposal.
 *      - The committee for the epoch is expected to disseminate transaction data to allow proving, so a prune is
 *        considered a slashable offense, that causes validators to vote for slashing the committee of the unproven
 *        epoch.
 *      - When the pending chain is pruned, all unproven blocks are removed from the pending chain, and the chain
 *        resumes from the last proven block.
 *
 * @dev Slashing Mechanism
 *
 *      Slashing is a critical security mechanism that penalizes validators who misbehave or fail to fulfill their
 *      duties. Slashing occurs for both safety violations (e.g., invalid attestations) and liveness failures
 *      (e.g., missing proofs). The slashing process is governance-based and operates through a signalling mechanism:
 *
 *      - When nodes detect validator misbehavior, they create a payload for slashing the offending validators
 *      - The payload is submitted to the SlashingProposer contract, which keeps track of signalling rounds
 *      - Each block proposer signals on a slashing payload during their assigned slot
 *      - If the payload receives sufficient signals (reaches the configured quorum) within a round, it may be submitted
 *        for execution by the Slasher after a configured delay.
 *      - The Slasher has a Vetoer specified in the constructor, which can veto the payload if it is deemed to be
 *        invalid.
 *      - Once submitted to the Slasher, if the payload is not Vetoed, the offending validators are slashed, meaning
 *        their staked assets are reduced by the slashing amount
 *      - If a validator's stake falls below the minimum required amount due to slashing, they are automatically
 *        removed from the validator set
 *
 *      Conditions that cause nodes to vote for slashing a validator:
 *      1. Validators that fail to fulfill their duties:
 *         - Committee members who fail to attest to blocks when required
 *      2. Committee members of an unproven epoch where either:
 *         - The data for the epoch is not available
 *         - The the epoch was provable but no proof was submitted
 *      3. Proposers of invalid blocks or committee members who attest to blocks built on top of invalid ones:
 *         - Proposing blocks with invalid state transitions
 *         - Proposing blocks with invalid attestations
 *         - Attesting to blocks that build upon known invalid blocks (e.g. invalid attestations)
 *         - This ensures the integrity of the chain by penalizing those who contribute to invalid blocks

   *      functionality is automatically called when `RollupCore.propose(...)` is called (via the

   *      selection is computed based on the stored randao and the epoch number, failing to update the randao stored
   *      will keep the committee predictable longer into the future. We would only fail to get a fresh randao if:
   *      1. All the proposals in the epoch were missed
   *      2. Nobody called setupEpoch on the Rollup contract

   *      preventing anyone from calling this function directly is not really feasible. This makes attacks on seed
