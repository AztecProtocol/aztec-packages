   * @notice Verifies the membership of a leaf and path against an expected root.
   * @dev In the case of a mismatched root, and subsequent inability to verify membership, this function throws.
   * @param _path - The sibling path of the message as a leaf, used to prove message inclusion
   * @param _leaf - The hash of the message we are trying to prove inclusion for
   * @param _index - The index of the message inside the L2 to L1 message tree
   * @param _expectedRoot - The expected root to check the validity of the message and sibling path with.
   * @notice -
   * E.g. A sibling path for a leaf at index 3 (L) in a tree of depth 3 (between 5 and 8 leafs) consists of the 3 elements denoted as *'s
   * d0:                                            [ root ]
