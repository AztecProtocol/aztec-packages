/**
 * @title InvalidateLib
 * @author Aztec Labs
 * @notice Library responsible for handling the invalidation of L2 blocks with incorrect attestations in the Aztec
 * rollup.
 *
 * @dev This library implements the invalidation mechanism that allows anyone to remove invalid blocks from the
 *      pending chain. An invalid block is one without proper attestations.
 *
 *      The invalidation system addresses two main types of attestation failures:
 *      1. Bad attestation signatures: When committee members provide invalid signatures
 *      2. Insufficient attestations: When a block doesn't meet the required >2/3 committee threshold
 *
 *      Key invariants:
 *      - Only pending (unproven) blocks can be invalidated
 *      - Block must exist in the pending chain (between proven tip and pending tip)
 *      - Invalid blocks and all subsequent blocks are removed from the pending chain
 *
 *      Security model:
 *      - Anyone can call invalidation functions (permissionless)
 *      - No economic incentive (rebate) is provided for calling these functions
 *      - Expected to be called by next proposer, then committee members, then any validator as fallback
 *      - Invalidation reverts the pending chain tip to the block immediately before the invalid one
 *
 *      Integration with the rollup system:
 *      - Works with STFLib for storage access and chain state management
 *      - Uses ValidatorSelectionLib to verify committee commitments
 *      - Validates against TempBlockLog storage for block metadata
 *      - Emits BlockInvalidated events via IRollupCore interface
 *
 *      This invalidation mechanism ensures that even though attestations are not fully validated on-chain
 *      during block proposal (to save gas), invalid attestations can be challenged and removed after the fact,
 *      maintaining the security of the rollup while optimizing for efficient block production.
 *
 *      Note that attestations are validated during the proof submission, but not at every propose call.

   *      1. Block existence and state: The target block must be in the pending chain (after the proven tip
   *         but not beyond the pending tip). Proven blocks cannot be invalidated as they are final.
   *
   *      2. Attestation integrity: The provided attestations must exactly match the hash stored when the

   *
   *      3. Committee authenticity: The provided committee addresses must match the commitment stored for
   *         the block's epoch. This ensures invalidation is based on the actual committee that should have
   *         attested to the block.
   *
   *      4. Signature context: Computes the digest that committee members were expected to sign, enabling
