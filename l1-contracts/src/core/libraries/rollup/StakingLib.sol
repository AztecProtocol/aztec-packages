/**
 * @notice Represents a validator's exit from the staking system
 * @dev Used to track withdrawal details and timing for validators leaving the system.
 *      The exit can be created in two scenarios:
 *      1. Voluntary withdrawal: Validator calls initiateWithdraw() -> recipientOrWithdrawer is the final recipient
 *      2. Slashing-induced exit: Validator gets slashed -> recipientOrWithdrawer is the withdrawer who must later
 *         call initiateWithdraw() to specify a recipient
 *
 *      The recipientOrWithdrawer field serves dual purposes:
 *      - When isRecipient=true: This address will receive the withdrawn funds
 *      - When isRecipient=false: This address (the withdrawer) can call initiateWithdraw() to set a recipient
 *
 *      Workflow for slashing-induced exits:
 *      1. Slashing occurs -> Exit created with recipientOrWithdrawer=withdrawer, isRecipient=false
 *      2. Withdrawer calls initiateWithdraw() -> Updates to recipientOrWithdrawer=recipient, isRecipient=true
 *      3. After delay period -> finaliseWithdraw() can transfer funds to the recipient
 * @param withdrawalId Unique identifier for this withdrawal from the GSE contract
 * @param amount The amount of stake being withdrawn
 * @param exitableAt Timestamp when the stake becomes withdrawable after delay period
 * @param recipientOrWithdrawer Address that can either receive funds (if isRecipient) or initiate withdrawal (if
 * !isRecipient)
 * @param isRecipient True if recipientOrWithdrawer is the recipient, false if it's the withdrawer
 * @param exists True if this exit record exists, false if not yet created
