/**
 * @notice  Library for governance proposal evaluation and lifecycle management
 *
 *          This library implements the core vote tabulation logic, and has helpers for getting timestamps
 *          for the proposal lifecycle.
 *
 * @dev     VOTING MECHANICS:
 *
 *          The voting system uses three key parameters that interact to determine proposal outcomes:
 *
 *          1. **minimumVotes**: Absolute minimum voting power required in the system
 *             - Prevents proposals when total power is too low for meaningful governance
 *             - Must be > 0 and <= totalPower for valid proposals
 *
 *          2. **quorum**: Percentage of total power that must participate (in 1e18 precision)
 *             - votesNeeded = ceil(totalPower * quorum / 1e18)
 *             - Ensures sufficient community participation before decisions are made
 *             - Example: 30% quorum (0.3e18) with 1000 total power requires ≥300 votes
 *
 *          3. **requiredYeaMargin**: the required minimum difference between the percentage of yea votes, and the percentage of nay votes, in 1e18 precision
 *             - requiredYeaVotesFraction = ceil((1e18 + requiredYeaMargin) / 2)
 *             - requiredYeaVotes = ceil(votesCast * requiredYeaVotesFraction / 1e18)
 *             - Yea votes must be > requiredYeaVotes to pass (strict inequality to avoid ties)
 *             - Example: 20% requiredYeaMargin (0.2e18) means yea needs >60% of cast votes
 *             - Example: 0% requiredYeaMargin means yea needs >50% of cast votes
 *
 *             To see why this is the case, let `y` be the percentage of yea votes,
 *             and `n` be the percentage of nay votes, and `m` be the requiredYeaMargin.
 *
 *             The condition for the proposal to pass is `y - n > m`.
 *             Thus, `y > m + n`, which is equivalent to `y > m + (1 - y)` => `2y > m + 1` => `y > (m + 1) / 2`.
 *
 *          These parameters are included on the proposal itself, which are copied from Governance at the
 *          time the proposal is created.
 *
 * @dev     EXAMPLE SCENARIO:
 *          - Total power: 1000 tokens
 *          - Minimum votes: 100 tokens
 *          - Quorum: 40% (0.4e18)
 *          - Required yea margin: 10% (0.1e18)
 *
 *          For a proposal to pass:
 *          1. Total power (1000) must be ≥ minimum votes (100) ✓
 *          2. Votes needed = ceil(1000 * 0.4) = 400 votes minimum
 *          3. If 500 votes cast (300 yea, 200 nay):
 *             - Quorum met: 500 ≥ 400 ✓
 *             - Required yea votes = ceil(500 * ceil(1.1e18/2) / 1e18) = ceil(500 * 0.55) = 275
 *             - Proposal passes: 300 yea > 275 required yea votes ✓
 *
 * @dev     ROUNDING STRATEGY:
 *          All calculations use ceiling rounding to ensure the protocol is never "underpaid"
 *          in terms of required votes. This prevents edge cases where fractional vote
 *          requirements could round down to zero or insufficient thresholds.
 *
 * @dev     PROPOSAL LIFECYCLE:
 *          The library also manages proposal timing through four phases:
 *          1. Pending: creation → creation + votingDelay
 *          2. Active: pending end → pending end + votingDuration
 *          3. Queued: active end → active end + executionDelay
 *          4. Executable: queued end → queued end + gracePeriod
