/**
 * @title EmpireBase
 * @author Aztec Labs
 * @notice Abstract base contract for a round-based signaling system where designated entities
 *         signal support for payloads before they are submitted elsewhere.
 *         Works with an IEmperor (i.e. a Rollup) contract to determine the entity that may signal for a given slot.
 *
 * @dev PURPOSE:
 * This contract allows validators to signal their support for payloads.
 *
 * There are two primary implementations of this contract:
 * - The GovernanceProposer
 * - The SlashingProposer
 *
 * The GovernanceProposer is used to signal support for payloads before they are submitted to the main Governance
 * contract,
 * resulting in a two-stage governance process:
 * 1. Signal gathering (GovernanceProposer contract) - validators indicate support
 * 2. Formal governance (Governance contract) - actual voting and execution
 *
 * The SlashingProposer is used to signal support for payloads before they are submitted to a Rollup instance's Slasher,
 * resulting in a one-stage slashing process:
 * 1. Signal gathering (SlashingProposer contract) - validators indicate support
 *
 * @dev KEY CONCEPTS:
 * **Payload**: A contract with a list of actions (contract calls) to perform.
 *
 * **Rounds**: Time is divided into rounds of ROUND_SIZE slots. Payloads compete for support
 * within a round.
 *
 * **Instances**: Refers to an instance of the rollup contract, which in this case is exposed via a simplified IEmperor
 * interface.
 * This contract only needs the instance to determine the current slot (to compute the round), and the current block
 * proposer.
 *
 * **Signalers**: Each slot has a designated signaler (determined by IEmperor).
 * Only the current slot's signaler can signal support, either directly or via signature.
 * In the current implementation, the entity that may propose a block (i.e. the "proposer") is the signaler.
 *
 * **Signaling**
 * - One signal per slot (enforced by tracking lastSignalSlot)
 * - Signals accumulate for payloads within a round
 * - First payload to reach QUORUM_SIZE becomes submittable
 *
 * **Submission**
 * - Payloads can be submitted after their round ends with `submitRoundWinner(uint256 _roundNumber)`
 * - Round winner must have received at least QUORUM_SIZE signals
 * - Submission window: LIFETIME_IN_ROUNDS (5 rounds)
 * - Each round's leading payload can only be submitted once
 * - `_handleRoundWinner(IPayload _payload)` on the implementing contract is called to handle the winner
 *
 * @dev SYSTEM PARAMETERS:
 * - QUORUM_SIZE: Minimum signals needed for submission
 * - ROUND_SIZE: Slots per round
 * - Constraint: QUORUM_SIZE > ROUND_SIZE/2 and QUORUM_SIZE ≤ ROUND_SIZE
 *
 * @dev SIGNALING METHODS:
 * 1. Direct signal: Current signaler calls `signal()`
 * 2. Delegated signal: Anyone submits with signaler's signature via `signalWithSig()`
 *    - Uses EIP-712 for signature verification
 *    - Includes nonce and round number to prevent replay attacks
 *
 * @dev ABSTRACT FUNCTIONS:
 * Implementing contracts must provide:
 * - `getInstance()`: Returns the IEmperor instance for slot/signaler info
 * - `_handleRoundWinner(IPayload _payload)`: Called during `submitRoundWinner`
 *
 * Note this contract can support multiple instances/rollups. This is because the instance is retrieved dynamically from
 * the
 * underlying implementation. For example, when the GovernanceProposer is used, the instance is the canonical rollup,
 * which will change whenever there is a new canonical rollup.
 *
 * This also means that if the new canonical rollup does not support the IEmperor interface, this contract will not
 * work,
 * and a different implementation will need to be specified as part of the payload which deploys the new canonical
 * instance.
