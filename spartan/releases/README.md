# Aztec Spartan

This tool helps easing the entry barrier to boot an Aztec Sequencer and Prover (S&P) Testnet.

For once, there's no rocket science here. This script does the following:

- Checks for the presence of Docker in your machine
- Prompts you for some environment variables
- Outputs a templated docker-compose file with your variables
- Runs the docker compose file

It should work in most UNIX-based machines.

## Installation

To configure a new node, create a new directory and run the install script:

```bash
mkdir val1 && cd val1
curl -L sp-testnet.aztec.network | bash
```

This will install `aztec-spartan.sh` in the current directory. You can now run it:

```bash
./aztec-spartan.sh config
```

If you don't have Docker installed, the script will do it for you. It will then prompt for any required environment variables and output both a `docker-compose.yml` and an `.env` file. You will also be prompted to choose whether to use a [named volume](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) (default) or if you want to use a local directory to store the node's data.

Run `./aztec-spartan.sh` without any command to see all available options, and pass them as flags, i.e. `npx aztec-spartan config -p 8080 -p2p 40400`. If you want to use a different key for p2p peer id, pass it with `-pk <your_key>`.

For more options, see the [Node Configuration](#node-configuration) section.

> [!TIP]
> Ensure that each validator instance uses unique ports to avoid conflicts.

## Running

To spare you a few keystrokes, you can use `npx aztec-spartan [start/stop/logs/update]` to start, stop, output logs or pull the latest docker images.

> [!NOTE]
> The above deploy script will connect your node to the p2p network where it will register peers and start receiving messages from other nodes on the network. You will not be in the validator set just yet.
>
> Once you connect and begin to see gossiped messages such as attestations, proposals etc notify notify a team member and they will add you to the validator set.

## Node Configuration

You can tweak your validator in many different ways. Just edit the `.env` file directly and re-run `./aztec-spartan.sh`.

Different env variables correspond to different components on the node.

### Publisher and Archiver

The Publisher is the main node component that interacts with the Ethereum L1, for read and write operations. It is mainly responsible for block publishing, proof submission and tx management.

The Archiver's primary functions are data storage and retrieval (i.e. L1->L2 messages), state synchronization and re-org handling.

|Variable| Description|
|----|-----|
|ETHEREUM_HOST| This is the URL to the L1 node your validator will connect to. For as long as we're on private networks, please use the value from above |
|L1_CHAIN_ID | Chain ID of the L1 |
| DATA_DIRECTORY | Optional dir to store archiver and world state data. If omitted will store in memory |
| ARCHIVER_POLLING_INTERVAL_MS | The polling interval in ms for retrieving new L2 blocks and encrypted logs
| SEQ_PUBLISHER_PRIVATE_KEY | This should be the same as your validator private key |
|SEQ_PUBLISH_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS  | The interval to wait between publish retries|
| SEQ_VIEM_POLLING_INTERVAL_TIME | The polling interval viem uses in ms |

### Sequencer Config

The Sequencer Client is a criticial component that coordinates tx validation, L2 block creation, collecting attestations and block submission (through the Publisher).

|Variable| Description|
|----|-----|
| VALIDATOR_DISABLED | If this is True, the client won't perform any validator duties. |
|VALIDATOR_ATTESTATIONS_WAIT_TIMEOUT_MS | Wait for attestations timeout. After this, client throws an error and does not propose a block for that slot. |
| VALIDATOR_ATTESTATIONS_POLLING_INTERVAL_MS | If not enough attestations, sleep for this long and check again |
|GOVERNANCE_PROPOSER_PAYLOAD_ADDRESS | To nominate proposals for voting, you must set this variable to the Ethereum address of the `proposal` payload. You must edit this to vote on a governance upgrade.|
| SEQ_ENFORCE_TIME_TABLE | Whether to enforce strict timeliness requirement when building blocks. Refer [here](#sequencer-timeliness-requirements) for more on the timetable |
| SEQ_MAX_TX_PER_BLOCK | Increase this to make larger blocks |
| SEQ_MIN_TX_PER_BLOCK | Increase this to require making larger blocks |
| SEQ_MIN_SECONDS_BETWEEN_BLOCKS | If greater than zero, the sequencer will not propose a block until this much time has passed since the last L2 block was published to L1 |
| SEQ_MAX_SECONDS_BETWEEN_BLOCKS | Sequencer will ignore the minTxPerBlock if this many seconds have passed since the last L2 block.|
| COINBASE | This is the Ethereum address that will receive the validator's share of block rewards. It defaults to your validator address.  |
| FEE_RECIPIENT | This is the Aztec address that will receive the validator's share of transaction fees. Also defaults to your validator's address (but on Aztec L2). |

#### Sequencer Timeliness Requirements

During testing, it was helpful to constrain some actions of the sequencer based on the time passed into the slot. The time-aware sequencer can be told to do action A only if there's a certain amount of time left in the slot.

For example, at the beginning of a slot, the sequencer will first sync state, then request txs from peers then attempt to build a block, then collect attestations then publish to L1. You can create constraints of the form "Only attempt to build a block if under 5 seconds have passed in the slot".

If this is helpful in your testing as well, you can turn it on using the environment variable `SEQ_ENFORCE_TIME_TABLE`.

Currently the default timetable values are hardcoded in [sequencer.ts](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/blob/master/yarn-project/sequencer-client/src/sequencer/sequencer.ts#L72). Time checks are enforced in `this.setState()`.

### P2P Config

The P2P client coordinates peer-to-peer communication between Nodes.

| Variable | Description |
| ---- | ------|
| BOOTSTRAP_NODES | A list of bootstrap peer ENRs to connect to. Separated by commas. |
| P2P_TCP_ANNOUNCE_ADDR | Format: `<IP_ADDRESS>:<TCP_PORT>`|
|P2P_UDP_ANNOUNCE_ADDR |Format: `<IP_ADDRESS>:<UDP_PORT>`|
| P2P_TCP_LISTEN_ADDR | Format: `<IP_ADDRESS>:<TCP_PORT>` or can use `0.0.0.0:<TCP_PORT>` to listen on all interfaces|
| P2P_UDP_LISTEN_ADDR |Format: `<IP_ADDRESS>:<TCP_PORT>` or can use `0.0.0.0:<UDP_PORT>` to listen on all interfaces |
| P2P_QUERY_FOR_IP | Useful in dynamic environments where your IP is not known in advance. Set this to True, and only supply `:TCP_PORT` and `:UDP_PORT` for the `ANNOUNCE_ADDR` variables. If you know your public IP address in advance, set this to False or just provide the full announce addresses.
| P2P_ENABLED | Whether to run the P2P module. Defaults to False, so make sure to set to True |
| P2P_MIN_PEERS | The min number of peers to connect to.  |
| P2P_MAX_PEERS | The max number of peers to connect to.  |
| P2P_BLOCK_CHECK_INTERVAL_MS | How milliseconds to wait between each check for new L2 blocks. |

### Prover Config

Please refer to the Epoch Proving Integration [Guide](https://hackmd.io/@aztec-network/epoch-proving-integration-guide) for info on how to setup your prover node.

During a governance upgrade, we'll announce details on the discord. At some point we'll also write AZIPs (Aztec Improvement Proposals) and post them to either the github or forum to collect feedback.

We'll deploy the payload to the L1 and share the address of the payload with the sequencers on discord.

To participate in the governance vote, sequencers must change the variable `GOVERNANCE_PROPOSER_PAYLOAD_ADDRESS` in the Sequencer Client to vote during the L2 slot they've been assigned sequencer duties.
