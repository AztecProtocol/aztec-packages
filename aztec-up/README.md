# The Aztec Installation Script

```
bash -i <(curl -s https://install.aztec.network)
```

That is all.

This will install into `~/.aztec/bin` a collection of scripts to help with running aztec containers, and will update
the user's `PATH` variable in their shell startup script so they can be found.

- `aztec` - compiles and tests contracts, launches infrastructure subsystems, interacts with the network.
- `aztec-up` - a version manager for the Aztec toolchain.
- `aztec-wallet` - a tool for interacting with the Aztec network.
- `aztec-bb` - the Barretenberg proving backend.
- `aztec-nargo` - the Noir compiler and simulator.
- `aztec-forge`, `aztec-cast`, `aztec-anvil`, `aztec-chisel` - the bundled Foundry tools.

Foundry, Noir, and Barretenberg are bundled at the versions `aztec` needs. Your own `forge` / `nargo` / `bb` installs still work under their bare names.

After installed, you can use `aztec-up` to install specific versions.

```
aztec-up install nightly
```

This will install the nightly build.

```
aztec-up install 1.2.3
```

This will install the tagged release version 1.2.3.

## Testing

```
INSTALL_URI=file://$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/aztec-up/bin $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/aztec-up/bin/aztec-install
```
