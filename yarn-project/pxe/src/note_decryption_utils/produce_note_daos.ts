/**
 * Decodes a note from a transaction that we know was intended for us.
 * Throws if we do not yet have the contract corresponding to the note in our database.
 * Accepts a set of excluded indices, which are indices that have been assigned a note in the same tx.
 * Inserts the index of the note into the excludedIndices set if the note is successfully decoded.
 *
 * @param simulator - An instance of AcirSimulator.
 * @param db - An instance of PxeDatabase.
 * @param addressPoint - The public counterpart to the address secret, which is used in the decryption of incoming note logs.
 * @param payload - An instance of l1NotePayload.
 * @param txHash - The hash of the transaction that created the note. Equivalent to the first nullifier of the transaction.
 * @param noteHashes - New note hashes in this transaction, one of which belongs to this note.
 * @param dataStartIndexForTx - The next available leaf index for the note hash tree for this transaction.
 * @param excludedIndices - Indices that have been assigned a note in the same tx. Notes in a tx can have the same l1NotePayload, we need to find a different index for each replicate.
 * @param logger - An instance of Logger.
 * @param unencryptedLogs - Unencrypted logs for the transaction (used to complete partial notes).
 * @returns An object containing the incoming notes.
