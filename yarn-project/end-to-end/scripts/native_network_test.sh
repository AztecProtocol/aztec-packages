#!/bin/bash

# Usage: ./native_network_test.sh
# Starts a test scenario where as many pieces as practical are
# just natively running - running on the same computer, no docker or k8s
# The script exits when the first command used, the test command, exits.
# All scripts are in the native-network folder
# The will run in parallel either in tmux or just interleaved
# They will log to native-network/logs, where it is easier to debug errors further up the logs, while watching tmux helps catch issues live,
# or where things crash and need to be tweaked and restarted.
# Arguments:
#   Expects a list of scripts from the native-network folder.
# Optional environment variables:
#   INTERLEAVED (default: "false") should we just start all programs in the background?
