This is a minimal [Aztec](https://aztec.network/) Noir smart contract and frontend bootstrapped with [`aztec-cli unbox`](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/cli). It is recommended you use the `aztec-cli unbox blank-react` command so that the repository is copied with needed modifications from the monorepo subpackage.

## Setup

Dependencies can be installed from the root of the package:

```bash
yarn
yarn install:noir
yarn install:sandbox
```

This sandbox requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to be installed _and running_ locally. In the event the image needs updating, you can run `yarn install:sandbox` (see [sandbox docs](https://aztec-docs-dev.netlify.app/dev_docs/getting_started/sandbox) for more information.)

In addition to the usual javascript dependencies, this project requires `nargo` (package manager) and `noir` (Aztec ZK smart contract language) in addition to `@aztec/aztec-cli`. The former two are installed by `yarn install:noir`.

## Getting started

After `yarn` has run,`yarn start:sandbox` in one terminal will launch a local instance of the Aztec sandbox via Docker Compose and `yarn start:dev` will launch a frontend app for deploying and interacting with an empty Aztec smart contract.

At this point, [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) should provide a minimal smart contract frontend.

This folder should have the following directory structure:

```
|— README.md
|— package.json
|— src
       |-config.ts - Blank Contract specific configuration for the frontend.
       |             You may need to update this if you modify the contract functions.
       |— app
              |— [frontend React .tsx code files]
       |- scripts
              |- [helpers for frontend to interact with contract on the sandbox]
       |— contracts
              |— src
                     | The Noir smart contract source files are here.
                     |— main.nr - the cloned noir contract, your starting point
                     |- interface.nr - autogenerated from main.nr when you compile
               |— Nargo.toml [Noir build file, includes Aztec smart contract dependencies]
       |— artifacts
              |  These are both generated from `contracts/` by the compile command
              |— blank_contract.json
              |— blank.ts
       |— tests
              | A simple end2end test deploying and testing the Blank contract deploys on a local sandbox
              | The test requires the sandbox and anvil to be running (`yarn start:sandbox`).
              | You can run the tests with `yarn test:integration`
              |- blank.contract.test.ts
```

Most relevant to you is likely `src/contracts/main.nr` (and the build config `src/contracts/Nargo.toml`). This contains the example blank contract logic that the frontend interacts with and is a good place to start writing Noir.

The `src/artifacts` folder can be re-generated from the command line

```bash
yarn compile
```

This will generate a [Contract ABI](src/artifacts/test_contract.json) and TypeScript class for the [Aztec smart contract](src/contracts/main.nr), which the frontend uses to generate the UI.

Note: the `compile` command seems to generate a Typescript file which needs a single change -

```
import TestContractArtifactJson from 'text_contract.json' assert { type: 'json' };
// need to update the relative import to
import TestContractArtifactJson from './test_contract.json' assert { type: 'json' };
```

After compiling, you can re-deploy the updated noir smart contract from the web UI. The function interaction forms are generated from parsing the contract artifacts, so they should update automatically after you recompile.
