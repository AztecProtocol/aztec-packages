This is a minimal [Aztec3]() noir smart contract and frontend bootstrapped with [`aztec-cli unbox`](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/aztec-cli). It is recommended you use the `aztec-cli unbox` command so that the repository is cloned with an example noir smart contract from the [`noir-contracts`](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts) repostiroy.# React + TypeScript + Vite

This was probably created by running the command `aztec-cli unbox {CONTRACT_NAME}`. Some settings assume that CONTRACT_NAME was `PrivateToken` and will require some manual changes (listed below). `aztec-cli` can be installed with `npm i -g @aztec/cli`, if you don't have it already.

The above command copied an example [noir contract](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/noir-contracts) into `/src/contracts` as well as the entire `starter-kit` [subpackage](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/aztec-packages/tree/master/yarn-project/starter-project). This includes a minimal frontend for the copied smart contract.

## Setup

Dependencies can be installed with one command from the root of the package:

```bash
yarn build
```

This project requires `nargo` (package manager) and `noir` (Aztec ZK smart contract language) in addition to `@aztec/aztec-cli`.
The former are installed within `yarn build` via

```bash
# install noirup
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/noir-lang/noirup/main/install | bash

noirup -v aztec

```

`yarn build` also sets up a local sandbox instance of the Aztec Network, which can also be done manually via

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL 'https://sandbox.aztec.network')"
```

This sandbox requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to be installed _and running_ locally.

## Getting started

After `yarn build`, the frontend can be launched with `yarn start:dev`, which will launch a local instance of the Aztec sandbox via Docker Compose as well as a simple frontend for deploying and interacting with the contract.

This folder should have the following directory structure:

```
|— README.md
|— package.json
|— src
       |-config.ts [PrivateToken specific configuration for the frontend]
       |— app
              |— [frontend TSX code]
       |- scripts
              |- [helpers for frontend to interact with the sandbox]
       |— contracts
              |- [noir-lib Aztec helper functions]
              |— src
                     |— main.nr - the cloned noir contract, your starting point
                     |- [other .nr contract files]
               |— Nargo.toml
       |— artifacts
              |— private_token_contract.json - these are generated by the compile command
              |— private_token.ts
       |— tests
              |- sandbox.test.ts - a simple end2end test deploying the PrivateToken to a local Aztec
```

Most relevant to you is likely `src/contracts/main.nr` (and the build config `src/contracts/Nargo.toml`). This contains the example smart contract logic that the frontend displays, and is a good place to start writing Noir.

The `src/artifacts` folder can be generated from the command line with

```bash
yarn compile # which is an alias for
aztec-cli compile src/contracts --outdir ../artifacts --typescript ../artifacts
```

This will generate a [Contract ABI](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-is-an-abi-of-a-smart-contract-examples-and-usage) and TypeScript class for the Aztec smart contract in `src/contracts/main.nr`, which the frontend uses to generate the UI.

Note: the `compile` command seems to generate a Typescript file which needs a single change -

```
import PrivateTokenContractAbiJson from 'PrivateToken.json' assert { type: 'json' };
// need to update the relative import to
import PrivateTokenContractAbiJson from './PrivateToken.json' assert { type: 'json' };
```

The command should succeed and return the address of the deployed contract. Lastly, we can launch the frontend:

```bash
yarn start:dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see a minimal smart contract frontend.

After compiling, you can deploy the noir smart contract from the web UI.
