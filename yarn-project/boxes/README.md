# Aztec Boxes
A minimal framework for building full stack applications for Aztec (using React).

## Introduction

This folder contains the "boxes" that are meant for quickstarts for Aztec smart contract developers, including simple Noir smart contracts and frontends.

## Debugging

If CI is failing, it may be due to incompatibility with previous build artifacts - running the following command inside this boxes folder should regenerate the artifacts.

```
./bootstrap.sh
```
