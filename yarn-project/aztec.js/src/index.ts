/**
 * This is our public api.
 * Do NOT "export * from ..." here.
 * Everything here should be explicit, to ensure we can clearly see everything we're exposing to the world.
 * If it's exposed, people will use it, and then we can't remove/change the api without breaking client code.
 * At the time of writing we overexpose things that should only be internal.
 *
 * TODO: Review and narrow scope of public api.
 * We should also consider exposing subsections of the api via package.json exports, like we do with foundation.
 * This can allow consumers to import much smaller parts of the library to incur less overhead.
 * It will also allow web bundlers do perform intelligent chunking of bundles etc.
 * Some work as been done on this within the api folder, providing the alternative import style of e.g.:
 * ```typescript
 *   import { TxHash } from '@aztec.js/tx_hash'
 *   import { type ContractArtifact, type FunctionArtifact, FunctionSelector } from '@aztec/aztec.js/abi';
 *   import { AztecAddress } from '@aztec/aztec.js/aztec_address';
 *   import { EthAddress } from '@aztec/aztec.js/eth_address';
 * ```
 *
 * TODO: Ultimately reimplement this mega exporter by mega exporting a granular api (then deprecate it).
