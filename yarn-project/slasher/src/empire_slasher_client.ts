/**
 * The Empire Slasher client is responsible for managing slashable offenses and slash payloads
 * using the Empire slashing model where fixed payloads are created and voted on.
 *
 * The client subscribes to several slash watchers that emit offenses and tracks them. When the slasher is the
 * proposer, it aggregates pending offenses from previous rounds and creates slash payloads, or votes for previous
 * slash payloads.
 * Voting is handled by the sequencer publisher, the slasher client does not interact with L1 directly.
 * The client also monitors slash payloads created by other nodes, and executes them when they become submittable.
 *
 * Payload creation and selection
 * - At each L2 slot in a slashing round, the proposer for that L2 slot may vote for an existing slashing payload or
 * create one of their own. Note that anyone can create a slash payload on L1, but nodes will only follow payloads
 * from proposers; we could enforce this on L1, but we do not want to make any changes there if we can avoid it.
 * - If it is the first L2 slot in the slashing round, there is nothing to vote for, so the proposer creates a slash
 * payload and votes for it.
 * - On their turn, each proposer computes a score for each payload in the round. This score is a function of the
 * total offences slashed, how many votes it has received so far, and how far into the round we are. The score for a
 * payload is zero if the proposer disagrees with it (see "agreement" below).
 * - The proposer also computes the score for the payload they would create. If the resulting score is higher than
 * any existing payload, it creates the payload. Otherwise, it votes for the one with the highest score.
 *
 * Collecting offences
 * - Whenever a node spots a slashable offence, they store it and add it to a local collection of "pending
 * offences". When a proposer needs to create a slash payload, they include all pending offences from previous
 * rounds. This means an offence is **only slashable in the next round it happened** (or a future one).
 * - Each offence also carries an epoch or block identifier, so we can differentiate two offences of the same kind by
 * the same validator.
 * - When a slash payload is flagged as executable (as in it got enough votes to be executed), nodes remove all
 * slashed offences in the payload from their collection of pending offences.
 * - Pending offences expire after a configurable time. This is to minimize divergences. For instance, a validator
 * that has to be slashed due to inactivity 50 epochs ago will only be considered for slashing by nodes that were
 * online 50 epochs ago. We propose using the validator exit window as expiration time, any value higher means that
 * we may try slashing validators that have exited the set already.
 *
 * Agreement and scoring
 * - A proposer will *agree* with a slash payload if it *agrees* with every offence in the payload, all
 * *uncontroversial* offences from the past round are included, and it is below a configurable maximum size.
 * - An *uncontroversial* offence is one where every node agrees that a slash is in order, regardless of any p2p
 * network partitions. The only uncontroversial offence we have now is "proposing a block on L1 with invalid
 * attestations".
 * - A proposer will *agree* with a given offence if it is present in its list of "pending offences", and the
 * slashing amount is within a configurable min-max range.
 * - Slash payloads need a maximum size to ensure they can don't exceed the maximum L1 gas per tx when executed.
 * This is configurable but depends on the L1 contracts implementation. When creating a payload, if there are too
 * many pending offences to fit, proposers favor the offences with the highest slashing amount first, tie-breaking by
 * choosing the most recent ones.
 * - The scoring function will boost proposals with more agreed slashes, as well as proposals with more votes, and
 * will disincentivize the creation of new proposals as the end of the round nears. This function will NOT be
 * enforced on L1.
 *
 * Execution
 * - Once a slash payload becomes executable, the next proposer is expected to execute it. If they don't, the
 * following does, and so on. No gas rebate is given.
