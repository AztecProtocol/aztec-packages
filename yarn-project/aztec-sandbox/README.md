# aztec-sandbox

Aztec Sandbox is a package that allows for a simple development environment on Aztec stack. It creates a Private eXecution Environment (PXE) that listens for HTTP requests on `localhost:8080` by default. When started, it deploys all necessary L1 Aztec contracts and then starts listening for RPC requests.

## How to run:

### Docker Compose

The easiest way to run is by using `docker compose up`. This will create two containers:

1. The sandbox listening on port `8080`
2. An anvil instance listening on port `8545`

### Node Server

You can also run it as a standalone node server with:

```sh
yarn start
```

It will look for a local Ethereum RPC to talk to but you can change this with the `ETHEREUM_HOST` environment variable.

## Examples

The package also includes 2 examples. There are some system prerequisites that you will need to run these locally:

- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
  - Node version > 18
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [jq](https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/)

Before running locally you'll need to:

- Head to `l1-contracts` directory and run `./bootstrap.sh`
- Then go to `yarn-project and run:
  - `yarn install`
  - `yarn build`
    And you should be good to go!

From the `aztec-sandbox` directory, you can run the two existing examples:

- Deployment, mint and transfer on an Aztec Private Token
  - `yarn run:example:token`
- An L1 / L2 uniswap token trade.
  - `yarn run:example:uniswap`
  - To run this example, you need to set the following vars:

```
export FORK_BLOCK_NUMBER=17514288
export FORK_URL=<YOUR_RPC_URL e.g. https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/API_KEY>
```

## Publishing

This package is set-up to be published on dockerhub by CI whenever there's a tagged release on `master` branch.
It's published under the tags `aztecprotocol/aztec-sandbox:latest` & `aztecprotocol/aztec-sandbox:<version-tag>`.
