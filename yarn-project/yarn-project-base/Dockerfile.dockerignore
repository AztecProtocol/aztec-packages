# The aim here is to not have to maintain a list of projects in either the Dockerfile or this ignore file.
# We need to be careful not to exclude the project directories, as you cannot then use a wildcard in a negation
# to re-include needed files. Here we use */* which doesn't exclude the directories themselves, but rather
# the files within those directories. As we haven't excluded anything in the root, we manually exclude root files.

# This is a sticking point, due to the project being under it's own dir.
# Need to unexclude the dir and then exclude it's files.
# TODO: These boxes might be better outside the workspace where they have their own dependencies
# as they're meant to be consumers of the project, not a part of it.
