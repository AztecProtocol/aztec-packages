# Account Entrypoints

This package contains different transaction entrypoints for the Aztec Network.

## Available entrypoints

- **Account entrypoint**: this entrypoint encodes the payload to start an interaction through an Account Contract. It is meant to be used with accounts implementing the interface defined by `@aztec/accounts`.
- **DApp entrypoint**: this encodes the payload so that it may run a dapp directly, instead of going through an account contract.
