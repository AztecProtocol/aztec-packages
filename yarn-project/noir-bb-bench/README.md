# Noir + Bb benchmarking suite

The goal of this module is to provide a simple place for people to construct benchmarks of witness generation and proving. At the moment it only pertains to UltraHonk recursion in the browser, but we have a similar module in ivc-integration that shows prover performance of our ClientIVC suite.
