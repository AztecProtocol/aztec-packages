 * be batvched together. As soon as an item with a different group key is encountered, the old batch is flushed to the
 * queue and a new batch is started.
 *
 * A batch can also be flushed to the queue if:
 * - it reaches the selected batch size limit
 * - or the batch duration limit is hit (in milliseconds)
 *
 * This ensures that batches don't grow too big and that they are flushed at a minimum rate of 1 batch every interval.
 *
 * The consumer side of this queue will process batches as quickly as possible.
