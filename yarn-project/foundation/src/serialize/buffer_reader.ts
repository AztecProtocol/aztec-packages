/**
 * The BufferReader class provides a utility for reading various data types from a buffer.
 * It supports reading numbers, booleans, byte arrays, Fr and Fq field elements,
 * vectors, arrays, objects, strings, and maps. It maintains an internal index to
 * keep track of the current reading position in the buffer.
 *
 * Usage:
 * Create a new instance of BufferReader with a buffer and an optional offset.
 * Use the provided methods to read desired data types from the buffer.
 * The reading methods automatically advance the internal index.
 *
 * @example
 * const reader = new BufferReader(someBuffer);
 * const num = reader.readNumber();
 * const bool = reader.readBoolean();
 * const byteArray = reader.readBytes(4);
