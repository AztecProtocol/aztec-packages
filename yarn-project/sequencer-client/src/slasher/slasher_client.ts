/**
 * @notice A Hypomeiones slasher client implementation
 *
 * Hypomeiones: a class of individuals in ancient Sparta who were considered inferior or lesser citizens compared
 * to the full Spartan citizens.
 *
 * The implementation here is less than ideal. It exists, not to be the end all be all, but to show that
 * slashing can be done with this mechanism.
 *
 * The implementation is VERY brute in the sense that it only looks for pruned blocks and then tries to slash
 * the full committee of that.
 * If it sees a prune, it will mark the full epoch as "to be slashed".
 *
 * Also, it is not particularly smart around what it should if there were to be multiple slashing events.
 *
 * A few improvements:
 * - Only vote on the proposal if it is possible to reach, e.g., if 6 votes are needed and only 4 slots are left don't vote.
 * - Stop voting on a payload once it is processed.
 * - Only vote on the proposal if it have not already been executed
 *  - Caveat, we need to fully decide if it is acceptable to have the same payload address multiple times. In the current
 *    slash factory that could mean slashing the same committee for the same error multiple times.
 * - Decide how to deal with multiple slashing events in the same round.
 *  - This could be that multiple epochs are pruned in the same round, but with the current naive implementation we could end up
 *    slashing only the first, because the "lifetime" of the second would have passed after that vote
