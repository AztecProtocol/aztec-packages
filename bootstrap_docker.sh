# Usage:
#   bootstrap_docker.sh [PROJECT_NAME]
#
# To build everything in build_manifest.sh:
#   bootstrap_docker.sh
#
# To build all projects leading up to and including yarn-project-base:
#   bootstrap_docker.sh yarn-project-base
#
# To build just end-to-end:
#   cd yarn-project/end-to-end
#   ../../bootstrap_docker.sh

# To build all projects leading up to and including end-to-end, from within end-to-end:
